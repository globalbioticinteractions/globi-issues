Also, they share these results (along with many other interactions) with GloBI via https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/refuted-biotic-interactions-by-eol . This is why a refutation appears for these plant visits plant interactions when querying for the interaction https://www.globalbioticinteractions.org/?accordingTo=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.inaturalist.org%2Fobservations%2F7201698 (see  attached screenshot) \r\n![Screenshot from 2020-06-21 07-40-09](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1084872/85227459-83706600-b392-11ea-8c6a-68ce32f74443.png)\r\n![Screenshot from 2020-06-21 07-33-08](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1084872/85227460-84a19300-b392-11ea-85c7-b3368b2a3332.png)\r\n\r\nTechnically, iNaturalist could query GloBI with for which iNaturalist observations were indexed *and* which observations were refuted. This would be one of many ways to help the iNaturalist community to curate their observation fields. \r\n\r\nAlso, I realize that GloBI translation of \"Nectar Plant\" to \"visits flower of\" is a conservative one. However, I feel that most observations actually describe some insect visiting a flower and that no clear evidence exists to support that nectar was consumed.\r\n\r\nI am curious to hear your thoughts on all this. \r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/647138202/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/647138865","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/437#issuecomment-647138865","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/437","id":647138865,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0NzEzODg2NQ==","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-21T14:55:51Z","updated_at":"2020-06-21T14:55:51Z","body":"@KatjaSchulz presented on their process to produce the collection of refuted interaction records at Digital Data in Biodiversity Conference 2020 .
