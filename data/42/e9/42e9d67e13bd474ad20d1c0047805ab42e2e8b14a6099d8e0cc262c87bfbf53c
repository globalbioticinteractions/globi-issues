Fuzzy matches are no longer accepted.\n\nThe name matching process in the GloBI index is quite naive currently (linking by id/name pairs), but at least the process is reproducible and versioned. Also, verbatim name data products are available if you'd like to apply your own name matching workflow (e.g., https://zenodo.org/record/14640564/files/verbatim-interactions.tsv.gz see also https://globalbioticinteractions.org/data) .

I remember implementing some basic code to detect/prevent homonyms, and more work in needed to improve this.  See also related https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/197 .
