This dataset would be a combination of existing species interaction datasets and occurrence / specimen datasets. Because the mission of GloBI is to integrate _existing_ datasets, I am closing this issue. Hopefully researchers out there can develop methods to create such derived interaction datasets for GloBI to ingest.\n\nIf someone disagrees, please feel free to re-open this issue.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/61135059/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
