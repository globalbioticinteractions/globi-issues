Anyway, as above, i don't think that this field has sense for Globi.\r\n> This dataset is exported from our Specify installation and i have added a new field now to the export >> associatedTaxa. I formatted this field according to DwC from two fields (interaction type and host taxon) [interaction type:Scientific Name]. I imported GloBI vocabulary for interaction types, so that it should be ok for the indexing in the future. For now, i filled in this field with unspecific interactions (interacts with), but i will elaborate this information later (parasitizes, hosts, is symbiont of, etc.). This is the most important thing about species interactions in our database and i look forward it to be indexed by GloBI in the future.","closed_by":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/728/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/728/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
