You can FTP as much as you like, we do not have issues with this. As for the variation viewer script, I would limit your requests to 3 per second or less if possible. \r\n \r\nOn thing that would help would be if you could include in your requests the &tool= and &email= parameters. This would help us in tracking any problems with the script. \r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\nIdentifying Your Queries\r\n\r\n    NCBI recommends that you use the &tool and &email parameters to identify all of your eUtils URLs. For &tool, choose a value that uniquely identifies your software. If your name is John Smith, use, for example, &tool=johnsmithsoft. If your email address is jsmith@hotmail.com, use &email=jsmith@hotmail.com. This email address is used only to inform the creator of the software of any problems. The NCBI does not use these addresses for mailing lists, although you can join the eUtils-announce mailing list if you wish.\r\n\r\n ","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/645414586/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/646169094","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/510#issuecomment-646169094","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/510","id":646169094,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0NjE2OTA5NA==","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-18T16:54:31Z","updated_at":"2020-06-18T16:54:31Z","body":"NCBI / NLM appears to have unblocked a current GloBI server, so the crawler can access the NCBI resource.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/646169094/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
