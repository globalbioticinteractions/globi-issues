At some point, page with id 754947 (i.e. http://eol.org/pages/754947) resolved to Calyptridium (a kind of flowering plant). However, currently, it resolves to _Aedes furcifer_ (a sort of mosquito).\r\n\r\n@jhammock @KatjaSchulz can you help me understand why it seems that eol page id 754947 has been re-used to describe a very different kind of organism?\r\n\r\nhere's the offending integration test:\r\n```java\r\n    @Test\r\n    public void lookupCalyptridium() throws PropertyEnricherException {\r\n        HashMap<String, String> properties = new HashMap<String, String>();\r\n        properties.put(EXTERNAL_ID, \"EOL:754947\");\r\n        Map<String, String> enrich = eolService.enrich(properties);\r\n        assertThat(enrich.get(EXTERNAL_ID), is(\"EOL:754947\"));\r\n        assertThat(enrich.get(PATH), is(\"Cellular organisms | Eukaryota | Viridiplantae | Streptophyta | Streptophytina | Embryophyta | Tracheophyta | Euphyllophyta | Spermatophyta | Magnoliophyta | Mesangiospermae | Eudicotyledons | Gunneridae | Pentapetalae | Caryophyllales | Cactineae | Montiaceae | Calyptridium\"));\r\n        assertThat(enrich.get(NAME), is(\"Calyptridium\"));\r\n        assertThat(enrich.get(RANK), is(\"Genus\"));\r\n        assertThat(enrich.get(PATH_NAMES), is(\" | superkingdom | kingdom | phylum |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | order | suborder | family | genus\"));\r\n        assertThat(enrich.get(PATH_IDS), is(\"EOL:6061725 | EOL:2908256 | EOL:8654492 | EOL:11823577 | EOL:11824138 | EOL:2913521 | EOL:4077 | EOL:11830053 | EOL:6152932 | EOL:282 | EOL:39835629 | EOL:39865587 | EOL:39868843 | EOL:39868886 | EOL:4223 | EOL:21203680 | EOL:6360216 | EOL:2500577\"));\r\n    }\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/268/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/268/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
