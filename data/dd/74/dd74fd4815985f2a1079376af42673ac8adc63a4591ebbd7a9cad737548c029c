I am curious to learn more about your datasets and the type of interactions they describe.\r\n\r\n Note that in collaboration with Arctos foiks like @dustymc @Jegelewicz @campmlc\r\n, we've even figured out ways to link specimen-to-specimen across collections. So, if you have specimen for both interacting organisms, I'd be curious to find ways to link those on the specimen level, instead of the less specific taxon level. Would be fun to do something similar with your collections!\r\n\r\nCurious to hear your thoughts","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/957854936/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/963580948","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/722#issuecomment-963580948","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/722","id":963580948,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACXQt845bxQU","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-08T21:16:02Z","updated_at":"2021-11-08T21:16:02Z","body":"@ninacourlee your IPT datasets have been indexed/reviewed by GloBI. \r\n\r\nNow, also the review report is available via:\r\n\r\nhttps://depot.globalbioticinteractions.org/reviews/globalbioticinteractions/ysu-bc/README.txt \r\n\r\nPlease feel free to re-open this issue, or share comments if you feel that your data records should be interpreted / indexed differently. \r\n\r\nThanks for your communication, and hoping to hear from you at some point. \r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/963580948/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/968277237","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/722#issuecomment-968277237","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/722","id":968277237,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACXQt845trz1","user":{"login":"ninacourlee","id":90766905,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNzY2OTA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/90766905?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ninacourlee","html_url":"https://github.com/ninacourlee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ninacourlee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ninacourlee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ninacourlee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ninacourlee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ninacourlee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ninacourlee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ninacourlee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ninacourlee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ninacourlee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-14T12:02:38Z","updated_at":"2021-11-14T12:02:38Z","body":"Dear Jorrit, thank you a lot and sorry for the delay.\r\n\r\nI checked the indexing of the data from our IPT, it seems that only two datasets were indexed now, but there are more to be indexed. I wonder why other datasets wouldn't be indexed:\r\n\r\n1) http://ipt.ugrasu.ru:8080/ipt/manage/resource?r=amphibiaparasites This dataset wasnt' indexed, perhaps because i used associatedOrganisms instead of associatedTaxa field. Would you recommend to use only associatedTaxa for taxon/parasite interactions?  If so, i will correct this.\r\n\r\n2) http://ipt.ugrasu.ru:8080/ipt/manage/resource?r=lizardmites This dataset was indexed fine, it has associatedTaxa field and looks good in Globi  [example Zootoca viviparia|host of|Trombiculidae Ewing]\r\n\r\n3) http://ipt.ugrasu.ru:8080/ipt/resource?r=fredy This dataset was indexed by \"habitat\" field, but i don't think that it is the right field for \"species interactions\".

GloBI uses \"related to\" interaction type and related the species to description of its habitat. Do you think that this information has sense for Globi?

Very helpful. \r\n\r\n> http://ipt.ugrasu.ru:8080/ipt/manage/resource?r=amphibiaparasites\r\n\r\nThanks for pointing out that GloBI doesn't index associatedOrganisms. I'll open an issue on that to add that to the indexed fields. (see https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/727).\r\n\r\n> http://ipt.ugrasu.ru:8080/ipt/resource?r=fredy This dataset was indexed by \"habitat\" field, but i don't think that it is the right field for \"species interactions\".

[example Inocybe perlata|relate to|soil among mixed litter and moss]\r\n\r\nGood question. I appears that some datasets do describe habitats that resemble more of a species interactions (e.g. habitat: oak tree), whereas other are a bit more general (e.g., soil among mixed litter and moss). I am ok indexed these fuzzy relationships, as long as the relationship is appropriately vague (adjacent to, or related to). Hmm. I'll might have to think about this one a little. Perhaps others like @seltmann have some ideas on this. \r\n\r\n > http://ipt.ugrasu.ru:8080/ipt/manage/resource?r=fungariumysu This dataset wasn't indexed, but it has the same field \"habitat\", i wonder why 3) was indexed and 4) wasn't.

I am also wondering why GloBI didn't pickup the habitat field. Also, I am curious to hear when you are expecting your newly added associatedTaxa to show up. I've made a note to revisit and review the collection separately. https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/728 . \r\n\r\nThanks again for taking the time to share your detailed notes. I believe it is these kind of exchanges that help us figure out better ways to share these valuable interaction data records. \r\n\r\nPlease feel free to close this issue if you think that #728 and #727 cover your notes. If not, please let me know if there's any other separate issues that you'd like to me open.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/969070481/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
