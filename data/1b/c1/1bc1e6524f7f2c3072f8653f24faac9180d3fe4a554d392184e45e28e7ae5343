The great thing about these storage box solutions is that they are relatively cheap ($15 / 5 TB / mo) compared to having to pay about $70 a month extra for a bigger server. The downside of these storage boxes is that they are a bit slower to read / write. The speed may not be a big issue for crawling content, but when doing I/O intense operations like indexing, the slower I/O appears to make an impact. \r\n\r\nAnecdotal evidence suggests that indexing Arctos datasets via https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/vertnet configuration takes about 30 minutes on SDD (local disk), whereas indexing the same datasets on the storage box takes over 12 hours. See log of unfinished data review below. \r\n\r\nSuggest to use storage boxes for keeping versions of data / data products, and use local (limited) disk for indexing / reviews.\r\n\r\n```\r\nSep 06 23:17:54 globi5 bash[2553]: elton version 0.12.4\r\nSep 06 23:17:54 globi5 bash[2553]: using local nomer found at [/usr/local/bin/nomer]\r\nSep 06 23:17:54 globi5 bash[2553]: nomer version 0.2.13\r\nSep 06 23:17:54 globi5 bash[2553]: Review of [globalbioticinteractions/vertnet] started at [2\r\nSep 06 23:17:54 globi5 bash[2553]: no update: using provided elton datasets dir [/var/cache/e\r\nSep 07 00:34:33 globi5 bash[2553]: [48.0K blob data]\r\nSep 07 12:16:06 globi5 bash[2553]: [48.0K blob data]\r\n```","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/819/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/819/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
