Instead of using `elton interactions` and `elton review` to collect the interactions records found in the DwC-As and the reports, I'm using `elton update -c $ELTON_CACHE_DIR --registry local globi-gbif`. It will create a entry in the local `access.tsv` of `globi-gbif` namespace with `application/globi`:\r\n\r\n```tsv\r\nglobi-gbif\tfile:///media/external/projects/globi-gbif/cache/archive/000050cba2f9a0ab1682623294724d960f47d1746e6d65dc1f0fbd88bbc063f7/./\t\t2022-10-18T12:03:27.165Z\tappli\r\ncation/globi\r\nglobi-gbif\tfile:///media/external/projects/globi-gbif/cache/archive/000050cba2f9a0ab1682623294724d960f47d1746e6d65dc1f0fbd88bbc063f7/./globi.json\t3a3b194f9b0b0fa7aed34f3e18f85cbee9c28\r\n6c74b7cef20a5925c526587f3a0\t2022-10-18T12:03:27.328Z\t\r\nglobi-gbif\tfile:///media/external/projects/globi-gbif/cache/archive/000050cba2f9a0ab1682623294724d960f47d1746e6d65dc1f0fbd88bbc063f7/./dwca.zip\t000050cba2f9a0ab1682623294724d960f47d\r\n1746e6d65dc1f0fbd88bbc063f7\t2022-10-18T12:03:27.526Z\r\n``` \r\n\r\nThen I'm using `org.globalbioticinteractions.elton.Elton4N -datasetDir $ELTON_CACHE_DIR` to create a neo4j version with this data. But I need to provide a `-taxonCache` and `taxonMap` in order to the taxonomy incorporate to neo4j db.\r\n\r\nFor that I'm using [taxon-graph-builder](https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/taxon-graph-builder) but I'm not sure if this the way things should be done. The `taxon-graph-builder` will create the `taxonMap.tsv.gz` and `taxonCache.tsv.gz` using the names extracted from `elton names -c $ELTON_CACHE_DIR` (all names in DwC-As).\r\n\r\nSo, how exactly should I do this pipeline to use `Elton4N` to produce a neo4j db?\r\n\r\nthanks.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/829/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/829/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
