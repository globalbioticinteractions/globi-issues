But, instead using of using the GBIF id, use the AFD identifier. \r\n\r\nPerhaps we can following the example of how [WORMS](https://marinespecies.org) points into GloBI - deep links are created by taking all WORMS:* ids from the regularly updated [GloBI taxon cache](https://depot.globalbioticinteractions.org/snapshot/target/data/taxa/taxonCache.tsv.gz) (also see https://github.com/jhpoelen/eol-globi-data/wiki/Taxonomy-Matching#list-of-resources).\r\n\r\nWoRMS example: \r\n\r\nBlacktip Shark (_Carcharhinus limbatus_) at http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id=105793 points to http://www.globalbioticinteractions.org/?sourceTaxon=WORMS%3A105793&interactionType=interactsWith and vise versa.\r\n\r\nFishbase example:\r\n\r\nBlacktip Shark (_Carcharhinus limbatus_) at http://fishbase.org/summary/874 points to http://www.globalbioticinteractions.org/?interactionType=interactsWith&sourceTaxon=FBC%3AFB%3ASpecCode%3A874 and vise versa.\r\n\r\nIdeally you'd deposit your taxonomy with @dimus http://globalnames.org , so that GloBI can cross-reference to all known ALA names using http://resolver.globalnames.org and populate taxon cache.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/331/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/331/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
