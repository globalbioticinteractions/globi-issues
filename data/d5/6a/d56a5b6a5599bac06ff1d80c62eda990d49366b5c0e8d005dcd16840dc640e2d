Highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus infection in farmed minks, Spain, October 2022. Euro Surveill. 2023;28(3):pii=2300001. https://doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2023.28.3.2300001\r\n\r\n\"In October 2022, an outbreak in Europe of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) in intensively farmed minks occurred in northwest Spain. A single mink farm hosting more than 50,000 minks was involved. The identified viruses belong to clade 2.3.4.4b, which is responsible of the ongoing epizootic in Europe. An uncommon mutation (T271A) in the PB2 gene with potential public health implications was found. Our investigations indicate onward mink transmission of the virus may have occurred in the affected farm.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nelton update globalbioticinteractions/ncbi-orthomyxoviridae && elton interactions globalbioticinteractions/ncbi-orthomyxoviridae\\\r\n |  grep \"3691\"\\\r\n| grep Spain\r\n```\r\n\r\nyielded -\r\n\r\n| argumentTypeId | sourceOccurrenceId | sourceCatalogNumber | sourceCollectionCode | sourceCollectionId | sourceInstitutionCode | sourceTaxonId | sourceTaxonName | sourceTaxonRank | sourceTaxonPathIds | sourceTaxonPath | sourceTaxonPathNames | sourceBodyPartId | sourceBodyPartName | sourceLifeStageId | sourceLifeStageName | sourceSexId | sourceSexName | interactionTypeId | interactionTypeName | targetOccurrenceId | targetCatalogNumber | targetCollectionCode | targetCollectionId | targetInstitutionCode | targetTaxonId | targetTaxonName | targetTaxonRank | targetTaxonPathIds | targetTaxonPath | targetTaxonPathNames | targetBodyPartId | targetBodyPartName | targetLifeStageId | targetLifeStageName | targetSexId | targetSexName | basisOfRecordId | basisOfRecordName | http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/eventDate | decimalLatitude | decimalLongitude | localityId | localityName | referenceDoi | referenceUrl | referenceCitation | namespace | citation | archiveURI | lastSeenAt | contentHash | eltonVersion |\r\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\r\n| https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/support |  |  |  |  |  |  | Influenza A virus | subspecies |  | Orthomyxoviridae \\| Alphainfluenzavirus \\| Influenza A virus | family \\| genus \\| species |  |  |  |  |  |  | http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002454 | hasHost |  |  |  |  |  |  | Homo sapiens |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 2009-11-30T00:00:00Z |  |  |  | Spain: Terrassa |  | https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/CY083691 | Influenza A virus (A/Terrassa/INS94/2009(H1N1)) matrix protein 2 (M2) and matrix protein 1 (M1) genes, complete cds | globalbioticinteractions/ncbi-orthomyxoviridae | Eneida L.
