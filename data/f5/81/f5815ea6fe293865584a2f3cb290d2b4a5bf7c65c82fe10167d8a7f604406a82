In this study, we identified ESs provided by planktonic consortia worldwide from the analysis of scientific literature. We also mapped the identified ESs onto forty-nine plankton trophic networks derived from presence–absence data obtained from two coastal surveys in three areas along the coast of the Campania region in the Tyrrhenian Sea (NW Mediterranean). The systematic review evidenced that ESs associated with goods provision and ecosystem regulation were the most studied categories, while cultural ESs were the least considered. The mapping of ESs across the Campania coast revealed significant spatiotemporal variations in plankton-based ESs, which depend on seasonal variability and local environmental conditions. Among the ESs, those connected with the regulation and maintenance of marine ecosystems dominated both temporally and spatially, highlighting the crucial role of plankton in ecosystem stability and resilience. Moreover, although the direct provision of goods and materials was less represented, food provision to higher trophic levels was widespread within each coastal sector, highlighting the crucial role of plankton biodiversity in directly sustaining the whole marine ecosystem and related economic activities such as fisheries and aquacultures.},\nDOI = {10.3390/su17031182}\n}\n```\n\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/1040/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/1040/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
