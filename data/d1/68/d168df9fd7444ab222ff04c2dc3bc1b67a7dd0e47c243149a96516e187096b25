One of the ideas discussed was to have mangal export a darwin core archive similar to GloBI one. GloBI would import this Darwin Core Archive to include mangal data. Other option was to use the mangal api to ingest mangal data. Another option was to implement a layer on GloBI that implements the Mangal API so that rmangal and python apis could use Mangal data. \n\nFor now, we decided to go the Darwin Core Archive route.

Please feel free to follow my example . . . \n\nJust curious - it seem to me that herbivory is simply eating plants right? So, this can be derived from the classification of the customer / resource taxa. E.g. if cow is eating a plant, than it is a herbivory interaction.

I agree that having a fine-grained interaction type can be super important.  Does Mangal publish the list of all interaction types somewhere?  I was looking at https://mangal.io/doc/api/#interactions which seems to list only 12 types. \r\n\r\n(p.s. I find the tabular format used by Globi to be super convenient to check these kind of things, e.g. \r\n\r\n```r\r\nglobi <- vroom::vroom(\"https://depot.globalbioticinteractions.org/snapshot/target/data/tsv/interactions.tsv.gz\")\r\nglobi %>% count(interactionTypeName, sort=TRUE)\r\n```\r\n\r\nshows me Globi has 34 interaction types:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# A tibble: 34 x 2\r\n   interactionTypeName       n\r\n   <chr>                 <int>\r\n 1 eats                1366862\r\n 2 interactsWith        768768\r\n 3 parasiteOf           284376\r\n 4 pathogenOf            83868\r\n 5 hasHost               72418\r\n 6 preysOn               58603\r\n 7 visitsFlowersOf       34028\r\n 8 ectoParasiteOf        22330\r\n 9 coOccursWith          19068\r\n10 pollinates            11593\r\n# … with 24 more rows\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'd love to be able to interact with mangal data directly in a similar way. (Though for both databases, it would also be nice if there were an agreed-upon set of implied interaction types, since the listed types are clearly not mutually exclusive!)  \r\n\r\n\r\nI also agree that additional metadata terms can be critical to see what is going on -- as much as I appreciate  the convenience of vertically integrated databases I've always been wary of lost metadata!  I think having a separate network id instead of just a study id is a big advantage of Mangal; though again, I'm not clear on if there's a better way to discover what other additional metadata fields mangal provides than by skimming the API docs?

I don't necessarily agree with the mapping @jhpoelen provided (it's not only lifestages, for example), and I think this is a source of major disagreement among DB which should benefit from being solved. Other than that, the ideas behind globi/mangal are (in my mind) strikingly different - we provide access to metadata-rich information of ecological networks, and globi is aggregating data on interactions.
