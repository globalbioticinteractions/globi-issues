So, I'm wondering if it is possible to include multiple URL's into `globi.json`. \r\n\r\nAnother issue here, is that the **plant names** in the interaction tables are abbreviated (e.g. `S_perfollatum`) and the binomial full names are in a separated file (`flowers.csv`). Also, not the usage of `_` (underscore) here too. \r\n\r\nI think that the `_` is used to normalize names to be used within R (or any other SW). There are also some names using `.` (dot) instead of `_`.\r\n\r\nWhat should  I do? Manually transcript the data or we can adapt **elton** to handle it?","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/818304779/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/818312281","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/630#issuecomment-818312281","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/630","id":818312281,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxODMxMjI4MQ==","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-12T23:40:23Z","updated_at":"2021-04-12T23:40:23Z","body":"I'd say to incorporate this as a feature into nomer or other name mapping functionality.
