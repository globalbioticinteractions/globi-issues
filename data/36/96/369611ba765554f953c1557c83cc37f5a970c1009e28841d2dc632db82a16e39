The\r\nCATAMI team will work with relevant organisations who wish to share their data to ensure\r\ntheir ‘in­house’ classifications map correctly to the CATAMI classification and will provide\r\nstandard templates to import data. An example is the creation of a CATAMI­CPC code file so\r\nresearchers using the CPC software to annotate images can use the CATAMI classification\r\nscheme and then import into CATAMI. To assist researchers CPC codes are given in this\r\ndocument, further information is available from Kohler and Gill (2006).\"\r\n\r\nWell, I'd very much like to figure out how to map existing classifications (e.g., WoRMS, ITIS, NCBI) into CATAMI and vise versa and include this into the GloBI Taxon Graph (see https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.755513 ).\r\n\r\nDo you have anyone attempting to do a similar exercise?
