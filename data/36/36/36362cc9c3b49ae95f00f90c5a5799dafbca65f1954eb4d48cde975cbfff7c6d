The reason for the corruption was . . . a (silly) out of disk space issue. I have monitors in place to automatically check on the health of GloBI, but apparently improvements are needed.

My apologies for the interruption and am open to ideas to prevent this in the future. \r\n\r\nPlease do note, that all data products (including the neo4j search index) are available via Zenodo (released versions) and GloBI's depot (snapshot version) via https://globalbioticinteractions.org/data .
