all! I'm glad to see this parasite database going into globi. I'm more biologist than programmer, so I apologize that the data were not more easily mappable to existing ontologies.\r\n\r\nI looked over the [interactions.tsv](https://github.com/millerse/Benesh-et-al-2017/blob/master/interactions.tsv) file and have a few comments. First, a silly QC question. The published csv file has about ~8500 unique interactions whereas the tsv file is about 9000 rows. I assume this difference is the result of taxon mapping, but wanted to ask how it might have come up.\r\n\r\nThe interactionTypeName could be more specific 'endoparasite of' instead of 'parasite of'. The data is focused on endoparasitic worms. Also, some interactions could maybe be labelled with 'facultative parasite of'. The data include a column called 'Facultative', which indicates whether a host is facultative or obligate. However, this coding refers more to the stage of the parasites life cycle than a specific host interaction. For example, if a parasite has a three-host life cycle (i.e. infects three hosts in succession before reproducing) and the second host is facultative, then it can skip any of the second host species listed for the parasite (i.e. the stage is facultative, as opposed to a specific host species).\r\n\r\n@cmungall respect for going through all the locations! All the mappings look fine, including spiral valve, bladder, and hepatopancreas. I see how subcutaneous is ambiguous. It refers to anything under the skin but not in an organ, so it could be skin tissue like hypodermis or muscle tissue. Thus, I am not sure how to best categorize these values. More broadly, I had no idea what the categories for LocationinHost would be when I started this data collection, so some are less specific than others. The only way to rectify this and make them 100% comparable is to go back through the original sources and find the most specific UBERON term for each case.\r\n\r\nStage, shape, and habitat ontologies are fine. Localities and dates could eventually be extracted from referenceSource, if one had a few months to go through all the sources...\r\n\r\nThe hosts in the dataset are also marked as 'typical' or 'atypical' (e.g. if the parasite rarely infects a host or does not develop in it). I don't know if there is a way in globi to mark interactions as typical or common.\r\n\r\nFinally, after a few queries, I think there are two other parasite databases that are not included in globi: the [global mammal parasite database](http://www.mammalparasites.org) and the [host-parasite database](http://www.nhm.ac.uk/research-curation/scientific-resources/taxonomy-systematics/host-parasites/) hosted by the NHM in London. An [R interface](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ecog.02131/abstract) to this latter database was recently published.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/330798999/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/331528733","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/305#issuecomment-331528733","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/305","id":331528733,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMTUyODczMw==","user":{"login":"jhammock","id":3026567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMjY1Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3026567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhammock","html_url":"https://github.com/jhammock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhammock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhammock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhammock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhammock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhammock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhammock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhammock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhammock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhammock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-22T18:41:10Z","updated_at":"2017-09-22T18:41:10Z","body":"using endoparasite is easy enough. @dbenesh82 , can you verify that the definition and context displayed at  http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002634 meet your needs?
