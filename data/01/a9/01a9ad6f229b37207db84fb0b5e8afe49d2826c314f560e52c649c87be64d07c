You can do that by taking making a copy of your spreadsheet and flipping the argumentId from https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/support to https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/refute and updating the referenceCitation to include something like \"Seltman, K. 2021. Plants are unlikely consumers of bees.\"\r\n\r\nSecond, the last dataset by Schulz was actually a refutation dataset, and will be excluded in future interactions.tsv.gz to avoid confusion.\r\n\r\nThird, at quick glance, the Global Web Database appears a data error: all the food web matrices are formatted in the same way, only this one appears to be incorrect. If you want to go the extra mile, you can contact the authors and notify them of the error.\r\n\r\nFourth, re: iNaturalist observations - if you are an iNaturalist user, you can review the related observations and strike up a conversation in the comments to try and persuade the authors to update their records.\r\n\r\nFinally, Sarah Miller @millerse has made an immense amount of contributions, but has not been in touch. However, you can open an issue on their repository and describe the suspicious records.\r\n\r\nIf you feel ambitious, you can include corrected records in the refutation dataset in which the interaction records are flipped. This way, future users can enjoy the fruits of your labor without having to complete rely on authors to update their records. \r\n\r\nThanks again for sharing your observations and suggestions and curious to hear your thoughts on your next steps.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/785516504/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/785519235","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/607#issuecomment-785519235","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/607","id":785519235,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4NTUxOTIzNQ==","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-25T02:00:01Z","updated_at":"2021-02-25T02:00:01Z","body":"Here's an example of a flipped interaction in iNaturalist observation https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/30846063 - a bee's flower is visited by a habiscus plant.
