I noticed that you made some changed in a branch ```https://github.com/nipomensis/lupinus-nipomensis-interactions-2017/tree/nipomensis-interactions``` instead of the ```master``` branch. Currently, GloBI only looks at the master branch of a repository, so if you'd like to make your updates known to GloBI, please make your changes in the master branch https://github.com/nipomensis/lupinus-nipomensis-interactions-2017/tree/master .\r\n2. In the default repository format, GloBI expects a file ```interactions.tsv``` and a file ```globi.json```. The ```interactions.tsv``` file is expected to use the first row as a column headers. I noticed that in https://github.com/nipomensis/lupinus-nipomensis-interactions-2017/blob/nipomensis-interactions/Lupinusnipomensis2017interactions.tsv you changed the name of the file ( ```Lupinusnipomensis2017interactions.tsv``` instead of ```interactions.tsv```) and removed first header row:\r\n\r\n```\r\nITIS:104419\tMiridae Nymph\tRO:0002622\tvisits flowers
