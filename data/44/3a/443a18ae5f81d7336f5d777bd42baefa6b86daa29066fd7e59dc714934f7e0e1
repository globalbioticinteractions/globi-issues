Time Investment - to do a full mapping from GloBI > \"GBIF Unified Model\" would take significant amount of time, I'd say at least about 40 hours to build a prototype for a translation from GloBI land to GBIF land. And this is assuming that the GBIF engineering team and/or their consultants are available to provide feedback and integrate the produced data into the \"GBIF Unified Model.\"  I am assuming I am not the only one to realize the effort it takes to do this mapping exercise. How have others been able to free up this chunk of time to take on this mapping exercise? How do you imagine specialized projects running a tight ship, to engage, participate, and contribute to your efforts? \r\n\r\n2. Suspected Gaps in Provenance Modelling  - one of the core design ideas behind GloBI is to establish a provenance of digital records. This came into being from the desire to be able to systematically trace the resulting index record (e.g., a row in one of your database tables) to the original dataset / process that it was sourced from. Or, phrased in a question: how are you keeping track of the specific source data and their transformation processes that lead up to data records showing up in the GBIF index? And, how are you keeping track of the various versions of the indexed datasets and their associated indexes? How do you cite a specific version of a record such that it can be retrieved at some time (months, years) in the future? \r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/1423250828/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/1423255749","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/870#issuecomment-1423255749","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/870","id":1423255749,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACXQt85U1SjF","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-08T21:22:14Z","updated_at":"2023-02-08T21:22:14Z","body":"(cross-posted to discourse https://discourse.gbif.org/t/biotic-relationships-are-reciprocal-relations-needed/3805/13 to encourage discussion)","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/1423255749/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
