Click the LINK below to DOWNLOAD corresponding datasets.\r\n\r\nDataset 1. The first dataset contains taxonomic checklists for all extant cave-dwelling bats species extracted from the expert-based International Union for the Conservation Union (IUCN) Red List database version 2020.1. It also contains the General metadata for traits included in the current version of the database: habitat preference, ecological status, feeding groups, geographical range, island endemism, geopolitical endemism, distribution range, biogeographical breadth, generation length, body mass, and threatening process.

The second dataset contains the bat cave geographical location (latitude/longitude) and recorded species.

The third dataset included in the database contains the measured land-use and landscape features of the cave surroundings using the georeferenced data from the second dataset. Reference for individual entries in Dataset 3 are included in Dataset 2.
