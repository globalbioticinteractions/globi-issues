Wow!\n\nI was wondering whether you can help me understand how to find the associations in your DwC-A registered with https://www.gbif.org/api/dataset/8a863029-f435-446a-821e-275f4f641165 . For instance, for https://observation.org/observation/260513669/, I was expecting to find something like:\n\n[associatedTaxa](http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/associatedTaxa): \"on: Heliotropium angiospermum\"\n\nto appear in the DwC-A, but then, I realized that associatedTaxa is not part of your meta.xml schema, as accessed via https://observation.org/download/gbif/dwca-observation-org.zip
