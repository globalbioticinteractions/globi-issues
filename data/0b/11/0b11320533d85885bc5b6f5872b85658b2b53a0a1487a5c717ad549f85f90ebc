And soon on EOL. Great to see and looking forward to exploring what can be done through rglobi.\n\nOne thing I noticed is that we have lots of images of plant bugs that you should have. I am assuming I can add URLs for the images in our next update?\n\nAlso, below is some follow up from the upload. I think I emailed this to you:\n\nI am using these URI for our relations:\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GCChIIChXvf98oMFg7OKUznflZiSP_XLdI_6mm0IP2w/edit?usp=docslist_api\n\nYou are welcome to use the list to update the interacts with relationship now if you like, or wait until the next update. The archives will only be moved once. At present they are on a development server for idigbio review. I'll move them to the production (and stable) location when that review is complete.\n\nI understand that GloBI provides only raw hypothesis of interactions. Is it filtered for EOL? We also try to provide only the raw data as many of the interactions are unpublished to science and we are in the process of evaluating them. In other words, it is not our objective to clean up the data regarding correct/incorrect information interactions because we do that using statistics in post processing. Not an issue for research, but just curious how it is handled for a consumer product like EOL.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/133/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/133/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
