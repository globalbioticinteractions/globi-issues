However, no detailed record is published on which elements in source data were used to establish those claims. So, while the process of extracting species interaction claims is reproducible via versioned data and code, retracing the species interaction claim extraction requires debugging or isolation of input source data. \r\n\r\nProposed is to provide an explicit record of how each interaction claim was gathered from source data.\r\n\r\nFor instance, consider the following source table:\r\n\r\n source | interaction | target\r\n --- | --- | ---\r\ncat | eats | mouse\r\n\r\nIn this case, an annotation record can be recorded using http://brat.nlplab.org/standoff.html like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nT1    sourceTaxon 0 3       cat\r\nT2    interactionType 5 8   eats\r\nT3    targetTaxon 10 14    mouse\r\nE1   interaction sourceTaxon:T1 interactionType:T2 targetTaxon:T3\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this, you can explicitly tie an interaction claim to a specific text coordinates of the terms that where used to construct it.\r\n\r\nIf a established annotation format (e.g. brat / standoff ) is used, existing tools can be re-used to overlay annotations with the original source data file.\r\n\r\nAlso see https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/elton/issues/11 .\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/436/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/436/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
