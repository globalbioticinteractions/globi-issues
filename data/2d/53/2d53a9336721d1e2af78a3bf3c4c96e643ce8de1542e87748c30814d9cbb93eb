And \"Resources can be thought of as identifiable records or instances of classes and may include, but need not be limited to dwc:Occurrence, dwc:Organism, dwc:MaterialSample, dwc:Event, dwc:Location, dwc:GeologicalContext, dwc:Identification, or dwc:Taxon.\" So, the definition of a resource is pretty broad. \r\n\r\nIn the example, one resource, http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/2309983 , is the id of an occurrence that is defined in https://github.com/jhpoelen/inaturalist-dwca/blob/master/observations.csv as a human observation of _Gorgonocephalus eucnemis_ . The other resource, http://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/133061 , the id of a taxon defined in https://github.com/jhpoelen/inaturalist-dwca/blob/master/taxa.csv with name _Enhydra lutris kenyoni_  . Combined with the observation field id and label http://www.inaturalist.org/observation_fields/879 and \"Eaten by\" respectively, you'd get something along the lines of this _Gorgonocephalus eucnemis_ was eaten by some  _Enhydra lutris kenyoni_  . \r\n\r\nThis approach is not specific to GloBI's needs. Other projects like uredinales-belgium-checklist https://trias-project.github.io/uredinales-belgium-checklist/ use a similar approach to link resources. This project involves some DwC contributors like @peterdesmet , so I figured this would be a good example to follow. Perhaps he can better address your concerns.

Personally I'd prefer not to approach it that way.\r\n\r\nIf we were to use this approach, what values would you put in all the columns for the pseudo observation? We can't re-use the observation ID, so we'd have to construct a new one (that wouldn't be recognized anywhere in iNaturalist since technically it is all the same observation). We could probably reuse the observer info, dates, and location, but info about \"identification\" would be trickier - we maybe can use the creator and created_at on the observation_field_value. If you want us to try modeling things this way, it would be helpful to have an example with few real observations with the columns filled out, and a proposal for what IDs to use for the pseudo observations.\r\n\r\nAs for the additional taxa.csv file - in my opinion there is useful information in there for the data consumer, but it doesn't fit well within the DwC-A. That file contains information on all taxa in iNaturalist, even if they aren't directly associated with an observation or observation field. For example to recreate the iNaturalist taxonomy in its entirety we need to include ranks not represented by DwC, like section, subphylum, superclass, etc. The structure of the archive right now has occurrence as a core, and some basic taxon ranks are columns in that file. We can add taxa as an extension, but we'd need to include a coreID and then repeat taxa info for all observations that reference the same taxa. And then to include ranks that aren't associated with observations or resourceRelationships (lets say some species has a superclass as an parent [parentNameUsageID]), if we wanted to include them we'd need to include rows where the coreID is empty.\r\n\r\nI see a few considerations for the taxa file - documenting it in meta.xml, making sure it contains all observation taxa as well as all taxa referenced by relatedResource, including other non-directly referenced taxa like ancestors needed to fully recreate the iNaturalist taxonomy, and ideally not repeating data.\r\n\r\nOne thing that is technically possible is to include taxa.csv as an extension, but leave the coreid index value empty. If we did that it would exist in the archive as an extension, with all columns mapped to term URIs, but not associated with anything as far as meta.xml is concerned. Consumers of the archive could be informed via documentation that the taxonID of that file maps to taxonID on occurrences, and also maps to relatedResourceID on resourceRelationships. From a data modeling perspective this is in my opinion closest to ideal - we can model the data just as we do internally, without needing to repeat anything, having the same taxa being referenced from the core and extension, and can include unreferenced ancestor taxa. We can't convey the relationships among the files in the meta.xml schema, so it doesn't play nicely with DwC-A. But I'd also argue that resourceRelationships as an extension already doesn't play nicely because there's no way to say what ID is used in resourceRelationship and it's up to the user to figure that out (currently it's a taxonID, but in your proposal it would be an observationID, and meta.xml doesn't allow us to declare that).","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/1710745808/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/1710765354","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/427#issuecomment-1710765354","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/427","id":1710765354,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACXQt85l-DUq","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-07T21:00:56Z","updated_at":"2023-09-07T21:02:36Z","body":"Thanks for elaborating. \r\n\r\nI agree that faking the observations by introducing proxy ids may be more confusing than informative.\r\n\r\nPerhaps ditch DwC altogether and stick to the a format like that shown in:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/template-dataset \r\n\r\nhere, a single table is used to represent an interaction claim.

I'd imagine that it'd take less maintenance to support only a single DwC-A product. And, the benefit would be that you'd have more eyes on the single product instead. I imagine that this increased focus would make improvement opportunities easier to spot. \r\n\r\nSo, to help reduce re-work and maintenance, I'd suggest to:\r\n\r\n1. merge GBIF and GloBI DwC-A products \r\n2. extend DwC-A with resource relationships\r\n3. extend DwC-A with observations fields as measurementOrFact \r\n4. use measurementOrFact as a bridge between the \"core\" (the observation in this case) and the observation field and specify the kind of annotation via the ResourceRelationship extension.\r\n\r\nfrom \"https://rs.gbif.org/extensions.html#http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/MeasurementOrFact\" - \r\n\r\n> [...] Support for measurements or facts, allowing links to any type of Core. [...]\r\n\r\nAs iNaturalist is growing, I imagine that mobilizing the association iNaturalist data is key to translating various aspects captured knowledge into a broader science community. And, I hope we'll figure out a way to build a bridge that doesn't require too much maintenance. And, I hope that iNaturalist will continue to invest in working with other biodiversity infrastructure to help exercise our collective skill to manage, publish, archive, exchange, compile, and integrate increasingly complex and interesting biodiversity datasets.\r\n\r\nThanks for your time and patience in trying to figure this out.
