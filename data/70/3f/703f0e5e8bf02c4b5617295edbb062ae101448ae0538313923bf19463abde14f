That archive isn't a valid Darwin Core Archive for many reasons, so I am curious why you publish it. In any case, from it I think I can surmise the intended data publishing model at least. I believe it to be the following, as expressed in an ER diagram, with liberty taken to leave in only the things I need to remember, plus the liberty to abbreviate a sets of terms with their class as a placeholder:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI am also curious why you opted for a new Association class when there was already a ResourceRelationship to do what the Association does. But most of all I just want to know if this publishing model matches your intent correctly since the Darwin Core Archive can't actually express all of that. \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1084872/142087593-915d4d0e-04bb-4d31-ab3d-b1a16ec98bea.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we weren't constrained by Occurrences (as in, they ceased to exist as a class), could you see Associations being an Event? Or an assertion about an Event? The difference is intriguing, and though it actually looks the same either way in the model I have created, there are distinct implications in terms of content. Here is a draft of the model as it stands right now.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1084872/142087581-29a94b1b-9b27-4363-8ee2-aef15cc32695.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand a simplified version of it for publishing purposes:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1084872/142087571-44b183c0-d10f-4a20-9540-7ecff03555ab.png)\r\n\r\nI'm curious about any thoughts you wish to share.\"","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/970928360/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/970929490","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/729#issuecomment-970929490","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/729","id":970929490,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACXQt8453zVS","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-17T00:30:49Z","updated_at":"2021-11-17T00:30:49Z","body":"and on 2021-11-14 @tucotuco shared by email: \r\n\r\n\"I have since found the answer to the question of why publish the invalid Darwin Core Archive - EOL.\"","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/970929490/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/970930966","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/729#issuecomment-970930966","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/729","id":970930966,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACXQt8453zsW","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-17T00:31:49Z","updated_at":"2021-11-17T00:31:49Z","body":"and the context is:\r\n\r\n\"to come up with a model by which the limitations of the Darwin Core Archive could be overcome and people could publish data that are currently a challenge to share without loss of information.

The EOL one is not responding, so I can't tell if the meta.xml file complies with it. Assuming that it does, there are differences between it and the Darwin Core text schema. First, the Darwin Core text schema requires that a core element be declared:\r\n```\r\n<xs:element name=\"core\" type=\"arch:coreFileType\" maxOccurs=\"1\" minOccurs=\"1\"/>\r\n```\r\nhttps://github.com/tdwg/dwc/blob/c545c438c89ccd21c6c26668dc61dc08a6288ed4/docs/text/tdwg_dwc_text.xsd#L20\r\n\r\nThe meta.xml file in your zip files do not contain a `core` element. Nor do they contain any `extension` elements, which, though they are not required, are the way to connect files to the one designated by the `core` element.\r\n\r\n```\r\n<xs:element name=\"extension\" type=\"arch:extensionFileType\" maxOccurs=\"unbounded\" minOccurs=\"0\"/>\r\n```\r\nhttps://github.com/tdwg/dwc/blob/c545c438c89ccd21c6c26668dc61dc08a6288ed4/docs/text/tdwg_dwc_text.xsd#L21\r\n\r\nIn place of both `core` and `extension` elements, your meta.xml files has `table` elements, which do not exist in the Darwin Core as Text specification, but clearly fulfill a similar role.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, your meta.xml file has no way to declare what the relationships should be between the files as would be the case with the `core` and `extension` elements. That must be done on the EOL side by some kind of convention that is understood and instantiated in the ingest implementation.\r\n\r\nThe bottom line is that I don't think you can do anything to those files without breaking something with EOL, and that I can't tell much more without being able to see the XML Schema the meta.xml files declares in its schemaLocation.\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/973700938/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/975834346","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/729#issuecomment-975834346","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/729","id":975834346,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACXQt846Kgzq","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-22T19:08:26Z","updated_at":"2021-11-22T19:08:26Z","body":"@tucotuco Thanks for sharing your detailed review notes. Perhaps a novel way to encode/package this corpus of indexed species interaction data can serve as a testing ground for whatever scheme you come up with. The diverse kinds of data records and origins, as well as the nimble development researchers would represent a realistic litmus test for such a scheme.  I am up to try out pragmatic ways to exchange species interaction data, just like what happened with EOL back in 2014.
