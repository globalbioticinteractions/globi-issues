The ecoregion indexes provided by GloBI allow for searching by well-defined terrestrial, marine, and freshwater regions. While the feature is described in the GloBI paper (see https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2014.08.005 ), the indexes are not prominently featured, so many users probably don't know of their existence. And, the indexing takes quite some compute power. \r\n\r\nThis issue is to document the geospatial indexing feature as well as a way to reconsider whether the ecoregion indexing is something that should be continued.\r\n\r\n@jhammock @seltmann @diatomsRcool @BrianHayden - I'd be curious to hear input from y'all on the topic. Have you ever used ecoregions in your research?\r\n\r\nCitations for the related ecoregion schemes are:\r\n\r\nOlson, D. M., Dinerstein, E., Wikramanayake, E. D., Burgess, N. D., Powell, G. V.
