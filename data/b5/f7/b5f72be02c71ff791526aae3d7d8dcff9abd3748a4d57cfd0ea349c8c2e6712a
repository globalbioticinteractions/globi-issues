Does this record point at the same image or at the original and then a copy of the original? \r\n\r\nthen add to that the claim aspect of the interaction -- would this claim then share 2 images Or just want to 1 image to represent it. Obviously in our ecosystem we us the 2nd case - needing just one image to show the two species and the claim. \r\n\r\nThis all has to do with a bigger question of images representing claims of interactions in general. \r\n\r\nBut from our perspective, when we start bringing the images into the system will we be getting duplicate images for each species and maybe other duplicates for interaction claims? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/688/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/688/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
