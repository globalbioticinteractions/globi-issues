Root cause was that the name \"gall tissue\" was truncated to \"gall\" which matched to \"Zeus faber\". The name truncation is a trick to attempt to match scientific names on genus level. I've added manual name corrections for the names while we continue to figure out better ways to do name matching. The changes should propagate in a couple of days. \n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/41812447/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
