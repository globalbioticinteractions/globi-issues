So this is why I am working with others to heavily invest in sharing evidence and findings relating to the fragility of scientific data (e.g., [1]) as well as exploring ways to make citation/access to scientific data (and their origins) location independent (see https://preston.guoda.bio) . \r\n\r\n[1] MJ Elliott, JH Poelen, JAB Fortes (2020).
