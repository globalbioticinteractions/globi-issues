I believe this series\nended up cataloged at MSB after the fact. I can try to track them down.\nThere will be other host vouchers that cite parasite GenBank accession\nnumbers in Arctos. Again, the issue was the parasites not being cataloged\nat time of publication. Not best practices. It would be good to get a list\nof these.\n\nOn Thu, Dec 26, 2019, 11:15 AM Katja Seltmann <notifications@github.com>\nwrote:\n\n> *  UNM-IT Warning:* This message was sent from outside of the LoboMail\n> system.
