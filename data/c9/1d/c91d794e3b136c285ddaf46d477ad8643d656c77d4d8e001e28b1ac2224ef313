No claim of redirect was intended. The images were not migrated in but re-harvested; that was the only practical way to correct the poor taxon mapping in EOL v2. Arguably most of the image files are still available in EOL, but many are attached to different taxa now and we made no attempt to track them. Thanks for pointing that out!
