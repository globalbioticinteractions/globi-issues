So Wardeh et al. use the sequence metadata records as a source of host records.  This gives them some host relationships that have not or only rarely been recorded in the literature.  Of course, this kind of evidence is weaker than an explicit assertion about a host relationship in a scientific paper, backed up by additional evidence about the relationship.

Suggest to remove the space to make it a little more consistent with how others write down dois.\n\n![screen shot 2016-05-03 at 9 48 57 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1084872/14991030/59f8526c-1114-11e6-9590-f17088b892a0.png)\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/216593501/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/216594601","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/176#issuecomment-216594601","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/176","id":216594601,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNjU5NDYwMQ==","user":{"login":"millerse","id":9950335,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5NTAzMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9950335?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/millerse","html_url":"https://github.com/millerse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/millerse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/millerse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/millerse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/millerse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/millerse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/millerse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/millerse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/millerse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/millerse/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-03T16:56:40Z","updated_at":"2016-05-03T16:56:40Z","body":"Thanks.
