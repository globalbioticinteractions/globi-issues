Right now now the nimble discovery tools use taxon level images retrieved from (mostly) EOL. I'd say it would be useful to have extra supporting evidence in the form of images of the actual specimen / labels used to describe the interaction. \n\nI've added a first pass at the interaction mappings. Once the production archives are available, we can poke around and see if the mappings are working as expected.\n\nEOL uses an aggregated archive that GloBI produces. This archive contains aggregated interactions by study - so if a specific study contains multiple interactions describing the same interactions (e.g. man (_Homo sapiens_) eats dog (_Canis familiaris_)), only a single entry is available in the aggregate archive. Also, in this aggregate, only interactions are included that contain names that matches against some external (meta-)taxonomy (e.g. ITIS, NCBI, EOL, WoRMS, ALA). However, GloBI allows for discovery of the \"raw\" interaction data on the specimen / observations / fact level . . . all GloBI exports / results are derived from that.\n\nPlease provide the production archives when they are available so that we can close this issue.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/95645950/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/99912370","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/133#issuecomment-99912370","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/133","id":99912370,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk5OTEyMzcw","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-07T15:32:58Z","updated_at":"2015-05-07T15:32:58Z","body":"Issue is related to https://github.com/jhpoelen/eol-globi-data/issues/126 .\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/99912370/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/107658515","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/133#issuecomment-107658515","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/133","id":107658515,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwNzY1ODUxNQ==","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-01T18:12:17Z","updated_at":"2015-06-01T18:12:27Z","body":"@seltmann just curious: are there any updates of TTD interaction dataset available?
