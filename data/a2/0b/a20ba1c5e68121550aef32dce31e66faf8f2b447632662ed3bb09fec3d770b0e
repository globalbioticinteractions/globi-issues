However, it is unclear if increased mortality results from changes in the dynamics of predator-prey interactions or due to prey increasing activity levels. Here we demonstrate that ocean pCO2 projected to occur by 2100 significantly effects the interactions of a predator-prey pair of common reef fish: the planktivorous damselfish Pomacentrus amboinensis and the piscivorous dottyback Pseudochromis fuscus. Prey exposed to elevated CO2 (880 µatm) or a present-day control (440 µatm) interacted with similarly exposed predators in a cross-factored design. Predators had the lowest capture success when exposed to elevated CO2 and interacting with prey exposed to present-day CO2. Prey exposed to elevated CO2 had reduced escape distances and longer reaction distances compared to prey exposed to present-day CO2 conditions, but this was dependent on whether the prey was paired with a CO2 exposed predator or not. This suggests that the dynamics of predator-prey interactions under future CO2 environments will depend on the extent to which the interacting species are affected and can adapt to the adverse effects of elevated CO2.\",\r\n  \"pub_keywords_subject\": \"Predation ;Carbon dioxide ;Fish metamorphosis ;Predator-prey dynamics ;Animal behavior ;Sea water ;Death rates ;Marine fish\",\r\n  \"pub_authors\": \"Allan BJM; Domenici P; McCormick MI; Watson S-A; Munday PL\",\r\n  \"pub_journal\": \"PLOS\",\r\n  \"data_repository_host_by\": \"Pangea\",\r\n  \"structure_schema\": \"TABULAR/INTERACTION_RECORDS\",\r\n  \"format\": \"DSV\",\r\n  \"dataset_title\": \"Elevated CO2 affects predator-prey interactions through altered performance\",\r\n  \"dataset_description\": \"Recent research has shown that exposure to elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) affects how fishes perceive their environment, affecting behavioral and cognitive processes leading to increased prey mortality.
