The idea is that a taxon id is more desirable than a name string. If there's an id available in addition to a (human readable) name, the id is used to do the taxon matching.

I'm going to get moderately technical here, but I think it's at a level that's understandable.\n\nHere's the query we're using now:\n\n``` ruby\nHierarchyEntry.\n  joins(:taxon_concept).\n  where(identifier: params[:id],\n    hierarchy_id: params[:hierarchy_id],\n    visibility_id: Visibility.visible.id,\n    taxon_concepts: {published: true}).\n  order(\"hierarchy_entries.published DESC\")\n```\n\n...At first, I assumed the problem was either with the `published: true` bit, or with the `visibility: visible` bit, so I removed both of them to find out... However, when I did that in production using your IDs, like this:\n\n``` ruby\nHierarchyEntry.where(identifier: \"167353\", hierarchy_id: 903)\n```\n\n...I still get NO results. It looks like we haven't stored that identifier in EOL.\n\nAm I missing something, or is that actually the problem?  Or are these IDs made up and thus I wouldn't expect to find them?\n\n_Regardless,_ what we're proposing here is slightly problematic. Could we instead add an _option_ to the API... say, something like \"include_unpublished\", and then it could return results that are either invisible or unpublished? i.e.: with that option set, we would run this query:\n\n``` ruby\nHierarchyEntry.\n  where(identifier: params[:id],\n    hierarchy_id: params[:hierarchy_id]).\n  order(\"published DESC, visibility_id DESC\")\n```\n\n...I hesitate to have it _always_ return unpublished/invisible results. We might even have _two_ additional params, one for published and one for visible, if that's more interesting/useful, but it sounds like it's not.\n\nAlso, at present the result doesn't _indicate_ in any way what's published/visible: should we add that? If so, we may have to make this a new \"version\" of the API (which is a PITA). :\\\n\nThanks.

Thanks for investigating, guys. If we acquire other API users who want to want to use provider IDs (I can imagine ITIS or certainly WoRMS wanting to use their own if they make use of our services, for instance) they'll probably also want to include their unaccepted synonyms. Those tend to have full records at the partner site; \"unaccepted\" is just a tag. Is it practical to store provider IDs for these names also? I'm assuming the partners provide IDs the same for accepted and unaccepted names. (?) If it's too hard for right now, it would be great to have in the new API.\n","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/78489557/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/97080518","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/110#issuecomment-97080518","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/110","id":97080518,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk3MDgwNTE4","user":{"login":"jhammock","id":3026567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMjY1Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3026567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhammock","html_url":"https://github.com/jhammock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhammock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhammock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhammock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhammock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhammock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhammock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhammock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhammock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhammock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-28T14:21:42Z","updated_at":"2015-04-28T14:21:42Z","body":"I see @HudaSoliman has closed the JIRA ticket we started for this, so I'm guessing at the next deploy these names will be present in the database?
