It turns out that GloBI has indexed a bunch of Pteronotus parnellii related interactions from various sources (see https://www.globalbioticinteractions.org/?interactionType=interactsWith&sourceTaxon=Pteronotus%20parnellii , see also attached image and https://www.globalbioticinteractions.org/browse/?interactionType=interactsWith&resultType=json&sourceTaxon=Pteronotus%20parnellii). One source of these interaction claims (involving a conoravirus in Mexico!)  is https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/KC633196 which was deposited as part of publication Corman et al. 2013 Highly diversified coronaviruses in neotropical bats https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23761408 .At risk of repeating what was already shared, can you walk me through the steps you'd take to assign the name Pteronotus parnellii found in this interaction claim/publication to it's appropriate, updated name?I am particularly interested in: \r\n\r\n> 1. what information you need to determine the appropriate name \r\n\r\n> 2. which sources you used to lookup the appropriate name and \r\n\r\n> 3. how you would record the name link. With this, I might be able to come up with appropriate ways to capture and re-use these complex name linkages between (potentially) outdated names used in publications and their appropriate, currently accepted names.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2020-06-23 11-51-17](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1084872/85787312-0883b400-b6e0-11ea-954b-f9d00713d2c6.png)\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/516/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/516/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
