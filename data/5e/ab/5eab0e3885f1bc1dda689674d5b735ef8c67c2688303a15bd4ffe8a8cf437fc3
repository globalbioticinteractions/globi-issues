The way you published the data in dryad in csv and shapesfile is very suitable for automated ingestion. This is why I suspecting that your data will be accessible through GloBI sooner rather than later.\n\nI had a brief glance at the data available at http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.nv5d2 and I have a couple questions:\n1. In `CCPDDlinkdata.csv` I noticed that column `CiteTitle` is truncated to 50 characters. For some titles, this seems to drop a chunk of the original title. For example, I assume that CiteTitle value on row 2  `Feeding ecology of marine cormorants in Southweste` refers to `Feeding Ecology of Marine Cormorants in Southwestern North America`. Is there any way to provide an updated version of the csv file with the full citation titles? \n2. Would you happen to have a list of doi associated to your citations? If so, it would be great if you could also include this as a column. GloBI has ways to automatically match a citation to a doi if necessary, but a direct doi \"link\" would eliminate any ambiguity.\n3. In the article, you mention that the taxonomic names are matches against ITIS. Is there a way to include the ITIS tsn for pred/prey in the csv file ?

Thayer, S.A. Wood, W.J. Sydeman, L.E. Koehn. 2015 Forage species in predator diets: Synthesis of data from the California Current. Ecological Informatics 29:45-56. DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2015.07.003. The data package contains a copy of the main data file as used for this paper, as well as the GIS shape files. Additional data are available as appendices and supplements for the published paper, including summaries for citations included and known, data synthesis for each predator species, predators without known published diet data, lists of predator species for each forage category, geographic gap analysis for each predator species, and temporal gap analysis for each predator species. Current predator and prey taxonomy was synchronized with data from itis.gov. Please, contact me if you have suggestions, find errors, inconsistencies, or any other bugs in the file. IÕd like to know of your use of the data, and to receive any manuscripts that utilize it. IÕll be happy to help you, as I am able. We are continuing to update the database since its inception in 2012 and are interested to receive suggestions for new or missed data sources. \n\nContents\n1. readme.txt (this file)\n2. CCPDDlocationdata_v1.zip\n3. CCPDDlinkdata_v2.csv\n1. CCPDDlocationdata_v1.zip\n   This file contains the GIS shape files for the location points and polygons for each study. The point files are based on the centroid point for each polygon. The LocatNum field in the shape files can be joined with data from the CCPDDlinkdata_v1.xls file below using the LocatNum field. The coordinate reference system (CRS) for the shape files is WGS 84. \n2. CCPDDlinkdata_v2.xls\n\nColumn headers are described below, each row in the file represents an individual predator-prey link. \n\nNote on redundancy. Some authors, for example those publishing long-term datasets have published diet data more than once, or different units for the same data (% # followed by % mass). When using this dataset, you will need to review location, date, and observation type for potential overlaps, and verify you arenÕt using redundant values by consulting the original publication. \n\nColumn Headers: \nPredPreyNum. The unique identifier for a record. Each record is one predator-prey link that represents a predator eating a prey. \nPredatorClassName. We include both class and family level taxonomy because they are necessary to sort among the taxonomic groups. Class works to distinguish bony fishes, cartilaginous fishes, seabirds, mammals and the giant squid. Family is necessary to distinguish marine mammals from pinnipeds. \nPredatorFamilyName. We include both class and family level taxonomy because they are necessary to sort among the taxonomic groups. Class works to distinguish bony fishes, cartilaginous fishes, seabirds, mammals and the giant squid. Family is necessary to distinguish marine mammals from pinnipeds. \nPredatorSciName. Predator scientific name reflects the current taxonomy and has been updated from the original published taxonomy if it was outdated. Current taxonomy is based on the itis.gov standardized taxonomic database. \nPredatorSciNameTSN. The taxonomic code associated with the predator scientific name, linked to the database at the integrated taxonomic information system (itis.gov). \nPredatorCommName. Predator common name based on itis.gov. \nPreyGroup. The complete CCPDD database includes all prey taxa reported in a citation. For this version and the accompanying paper, we focused on a subset of 32 forage taxa (see Table 2 in the accompanying manuscript) that we extracted from the larger database. These forage taxa are represented in the field Òprey groupÓ. In some cases a prey group was at the species level, so it has the same value as PreySciName (e.g., Sardinops sagax). In other cases, prey were not always reported at the same taxonomic level (e.g., Pleuronectidae vs. Lyopsetta exilis) so we had to distinguish between our prey group of interest and the taxonomic level that was reported in the paper. \nPreyGroupTSN. The taxonomic code associated with the prey group name, linked to the database at the integrated taxonomic information system (itis.gov). \nPreySciName. The prey scientific name as it was reported in the original citation, although taxonomy has been updated to the current name from itis.gov. Because of difficulty distinguishing some prey at the species level, many prey were reported at higher than the species level, e.g., Sebastes. Although we did not analyze the data based on PreySciName, it can be helpful to know the name as originally reported in the citation, as opposed to the Prey Group Name we used for our analyses. \nPreySciNameTSN. The taxonomic code associated with the prey scientific name, linked to the database at the integrated taxonomic information system (itis.gov). \nCiteAuth. The citation author names. \nCiteYear. Citation year.  \nCiteTitle. Citation title. \nCiteSource. Citation source name (book, journal, report, thesis). \nCiteVolume. Citation volume. \nCitePages. Citation page numbers. \nLocatName. The location name for each record. Format is: Country, State/Province, specific location as reported in original citation\nLocatNum. The unique identifying number for each location in the database. This number is used for linking with the GIS shape file via the field LocatNum. \nLocatSpan. Use this field to identify locations based on the 7 geographic regions in the paper (Canada, Washington, Oregon, California-northern, California-central, California-southern, Mexico). When a study spanned more than one region, this field includes the word ÔspanÕ preceding the regions that it spanned. \nDateName. Study date as reported in the original citation. Format is YYYY/MM/DD-YYYY/MM/DD, where the Ô-Ô indicates duration of the study. In some cases, date was not reported, this is indicated by a Ô<Õ followed by the year of the publication to approximate the era the data came from. \nObsTypeName. The type of observation that was recorded, includes bill load, burrow load, chemical analysis, dip net, dropped prey, GI tract, pellet, regurgitation, scat, stomach content, tow net, visual observation. \nAdjustedSampleSize. The adjusted sample size is the original sample size with empty samples excluded, when data were provided. In some cases, authors did not report sample size so this field is blank. \nAnnualSeasonal. Annual=1, Seasonal: 2=summer april-sept, 3=winter oct-may, 4=mixed summer and winter months \nUnits#. Study has prey data recorded as number of prey items. \nUnits%#. Study has prey data recorded as percent number of prey items. \nUnitsFO. Study has prey data recorded as frequency of occurrence of prey items. \nUnits%FO. Study has prey data recorded as percent frequency of occurrence of prey items.  \nUnitsMassVol. Study has prey data recorded as mass or volume of prey items. \nUnits%MassVol. Study has prey data recorded as percent mass or percent volume of prey items. \nUnitsIndex. Study has prey data recorded as an index (e.g., index of relative importance, IRI) of prey items. \nUnits%Index. Study has prey data recorded as a percent index (e.g., percent index of relative importance, %IRI) of prey items. \n\nContact:  Amber Szoboszlai, Farallon Institute for Advanced Ecosystem Research, 101 H Street, Petaluma, CA 94954.
