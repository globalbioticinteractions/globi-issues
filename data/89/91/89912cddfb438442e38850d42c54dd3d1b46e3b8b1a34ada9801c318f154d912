Rather than using GloBI terms, we'd like to use an existing ontology such as UBERON to avoid re-inventing the wheel.\n\nThe mapping current mapping file for life stage, body part and physiological state can be found here:\nhttps://raw.github.com/jhpoelen/eol-globi-data/master/eol-globi-data-tool/src/main/resources/org/eol/globi/service/globi-uberon-mapping.txt\n\n@cmungall I've tried to mimic the spire to envo mapping.  please let me know if this works for you.\n\n@jsimons9 the mapping above can serve as the controlled list for now.  Only items on this list should/ can be used for adding new data.  If there's missing items, please feel free to add terms in same format.  Please note that the file is _tab_ separated.
