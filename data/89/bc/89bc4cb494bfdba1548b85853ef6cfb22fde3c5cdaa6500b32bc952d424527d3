Traditional research methods including direct observation of feeding behaviour, gut content analysis, choice tests, and litter bags have provided a wealth of information on earthworm feeding. However, there is a lack of the mechanistic, quantitative information required to characterise adequately their functional role in soil ecosystem processes such as soil C sequestration and loss, decomposition of organic residues, the maintenance of soil structure and trophic interactions with plants and microorganisms. Stable isotope ratio analysis of light elements (C, N, and S) offers a powerful research tool to reveal and quantify trophic relationships of earthworms in soil food webs, while molecular techniques can further enhance understanding of the interactions between earthworms and microorganisms and their functional significance.\nKeywords: Oligochaeta; Food preferences; Ingestion; Assimilation; Earthworm–microbial interactions; Stable isotopes","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/1119/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/1119/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
