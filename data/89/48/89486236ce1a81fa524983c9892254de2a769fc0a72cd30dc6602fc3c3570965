Unfortunately it appears to have disappeared from GloBI and even the old version (#994) is no longer listed under \"datasets\"\r\n\r\nI searched for a few taxon names (`Paramecium caudatum`, `Candidatus Megaira polyxenophila`) that were in the first version but couldn't find the dataset by this route either.\r\n\r\nCould something have gone wrong with the indexing process? Is there something that I may have changed inadvertently along the way?\r\n\r\nThanks!","closed_by":{"login":"kbseah","id":9416913,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0MTY5MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9416913?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbseah","html_url":"https://github.com/kbseah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbseah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbseah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbseah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbseah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbseah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbseah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbseah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbseah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbseah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/1005/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/1005/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
