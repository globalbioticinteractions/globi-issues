The method imagesForName does two things: 1) it looks up the eol id associated with the name (should be fast 'cause it is an internal lookup). After this, it calls the EOL api (external api) to retrieve the image url. After initial success, the results are cached for 24 hours on the GloBI server. On error, the result is not cached and the api will try again on the next request.\n\nFrom the stack trace you shared, the line `at org.eol.globi.service.EOLTaxonImageService.getPageInfo(EOLTaxonImageService.java:89)` indicates that the request to the EOL API timed-out. \n\nI've seen similar \"500\" when working with the EOL lately and I am sure that @jrice and @jhammock are aware of the these issues. I am hoping to implement #195 (pre-indexing of taxon images) so that retrieving of images does not directly rely on an external image url lookup. How urgent is it?\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/164200637/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/164301697","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/196#issuecomment-164301697","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/196","id":164301697,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NDMwMTY5Nw==","user":{"login":"danielabar","id":2428282,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2428282?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielabar","html_url":"https://github.com/danielabar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielabar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielabar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielabar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielabar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielabar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielabar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielabar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielabar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielabar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-13T21:56:45Z","updated_at":"2015-12-13T21:56:45Z","body":"The demo is this Wed.
