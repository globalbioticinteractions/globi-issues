You would only receive an identifier for your download, and end users using GLOBI would be untraceable for us, and would not be given that token presumably / it's not the intended correct use of the database for them to use your download. We want to move to a DOI system for both downloads and datasets (like GBIF) so this is more seamless, but it'll take a bit.\n- your terms do not give users the same specific obligations. This is again why we're hoping folks won't republish data while we work on getting options to publish under CC-0, CC-BY, and CC-BY-SA available, probably with a default to CC-BY-SA to ensure that the obligation to attribute credit to researchers follows the data.\n\nHope that helps!","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/3439441877/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/3439561640","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/1107#issuecomment-3439561640","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/1107","id":3439561640,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACXQt87NA4uo","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-10-23T22:45:03Z","updated_at":"2025-10-23T22:49:23Z","body":"Thanks again for your prompt reply.\n\n> Hope that helps!\n\nSounds like your issuing a new dataset for each data download using a point-and-click workflow. \n\nAlso, this assumes that the data appendices in papers that use these data would not be able to be re-published, and thus making review of the results difficult at best, at impossible at worst, because the data is likely to disappear due to well known effect of link rot and content drift of digital data. \n\nIn my mind you chose to have folks only access/reuse the data through your platform and prevent the data from being reused elsewhere.\n\nHow can you frame this to be in line with the concept of open science with open reviews and open data? \n\nAnd, GloBI is (semi-automatically) publishing reviews and interpretations of existing openly available datasets with full data attribution. So, the origin of the data would still be traceable, and you can still count your usage in publications.

That is pretty neat, especially because of the DOI / handle system does a pretty good job keeping their single DOI redirection system up and running for paying members.\n\nHowever, I don't see how the provenance of the data, let alone the data itself, is document that way (by using DOIs). How are you securely and verifiably linking a doi (just a digital sequence of characters in a certain format) to a custom created digital dataset when a Pharos user clicks on a download button? Do they have to trust that Pharos (or some other DOI member like Zenodo) will stick around for ever as well as the doi / handle system and this specific type of data exchange network we call the internet?
