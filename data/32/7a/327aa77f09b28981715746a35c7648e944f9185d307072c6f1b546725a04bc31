I've started going down the rabbit hole recently with creating a way of exploring the data from the perspective of virus-host co-associations. So far I've developed an \"RdRP-first\" interface for querying where a particular RNA virus (marked by RdRP sequence) shows up in sequencing libraries, and pulling geospatial and host-associated meta-data as well as the SRA-STAT host kmer classifications associated with these libraries. You can see how the prototype interface generally works via [`palmID'](https://serratus.io/palmid). \r\n\r\nThis isn't a \"clean\" dataset, and a little out of my depth/expertise for building the networks such as those that you have with globi. Would y'all be interested in incorporating such data (mostly unknown virus networks) and how best should I parse/prepare the data to make it most useful for integration into GloBi? Good start might be something simple like \"What kind of `viruses` are associated with `<your taxa>`?","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/760/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/760/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
