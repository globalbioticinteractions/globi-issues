Root cause was that basic homonym check was skipped due to invalid parsing of global names hierarchies: empty hierarchy entries were skipped causing a misalignment in taxon names, ids and ranks. This misalignment disabled the homonym check. \n\nParsing issue was fixed and test case was introduced to validate the fix. \n\nClosing issue after confirming that changes have propagated (est. in a day or two).\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/235442898/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/235942659","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/239#issuecomment-235942659","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/239","id":235942659,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNTk0MjY1OQ==","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-28T16:06:41Z","updated_at":"2016-07-28T16:06:41Z","body":"Changes have propagated and the observed invalid interactions are not longer present.
