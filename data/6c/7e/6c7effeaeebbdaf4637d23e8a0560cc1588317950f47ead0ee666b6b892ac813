And “Unidentified” has a \"NCBI Taxonomy” classification too. (see http://eol.org/pages/2913255/overview). GloBI is unaware that this page is not a taxon, and simply treats it like one because it has a \"valid\" classification. \n\nAs suggested by @KatjaSchulz \n\n_[...] Several of our classification providers give us bogus names in their hierarchies like unknown, indet., unidentified, and worse.  We dutifully create pages for these \"names\" and they cluster together in taxon concepts based on name similarity.  I have started a collection of pages for such non-taxa hoping that one day we may find the time to do something about this issue, e.g., by simply not including them in any taxon concepts.  Maybe you could use that collection to get the EOL ids to exclude from GloBi processing?
