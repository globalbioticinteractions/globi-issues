Seven geophysical variables were derived from the SRTM30_PLUS high resolution bathymetry dataset.  These layers characterize the horizontal orientation (aspect), slope, and curvature of the seafloor and the distance from shore.  Ten “bioclimatic” variables were derived from NOAA’s World Ocean Atlas and NASA’s MODIS satellite imagery and characterize the inter-annual means, extremes, and variances in sea surface temperature and salinity.  All variables are available as ESRI raster grids at a 30 arc-second spatial resolution (also known as “1 km” grids) and use a common land mask.  These variables will be useful to those interested in the spatial ecology of marine shallow-water and surface-associated pelagic organisms across the globe.\n\nSbrocco, EJ and Barber, PH (2013) MARSPEC: Ocean climate layers for marine spatial ecology.
