(see attached screenshot of https://www.globalbioticinteractions.org/?accordingTo=globi%3Aglobalbioticinteractions%2Ffmnh&interactionType=ecologicallyRelatedTo&sourceTaxon=Penicillidia%20fulvida) \r\n\r\nNote that, for some reason, the target record (e.g., 7048675a-b110-4baf-91a3-2db138316709 ) has not yet been resolved . I've confirmed that the record is actually part of the fmnh_mammals collection. So this hint to an indexing funkiness on GloBI's end.\r\n\r\n```\r\n# find recent version of fmnh_mammals \r\n$ cat /var/cache/elton/datasets/globalbioticinteractions/fmnh/access.tsv | grep mammals | tail -n1\r\nglobalbioticinteractions/fmnh\thttps://fmipt.fieldmuseum.org/ipt/archive.do?r=fmnh_mammals\t5a0dd631a31cc66b0a29040745507a1d5962d6041d3a206b34db44766daba357\t2021-02-26T23:54:42.062Z\t\r\n# lookup 7048675a-b110-4baf-91a3-2db138316709\r\n$ unzip -p /var/cache/elton/datasets/globalbioticinteractions/fmnh/5a0dd631a31cc66b0a29040745507a1d5962d6041d3a206b34db44766daba357 occurrence.txt | grep \"7048675a-b110-4baf-91a3-2db138316709\"\r\n7048675a-b110-4baf-91a3-2db138316709\tPhysicalObject\t2020-1-9T15:42:53.000CMT\ten\thttps://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\tThe Field Museum of Natural History\thttp://fieldmuseum.org/about/copyright-information\t\t\tFMNH\tMammals\tmammals-24-sep-2020\tFMNH\tMammals\t\tFMNH\tPreservedSpecimen\t7048675a-b110-4baf-91a3-2db138316709\t83596\t\t8963\tG.
