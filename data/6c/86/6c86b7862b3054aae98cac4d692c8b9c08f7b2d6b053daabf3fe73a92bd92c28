Thus you could do queries such as \"find all symbiotic interactions\" without explicitly listing all subtypes (mutualist, parasite), just as you can query for mammals without listing every mammal.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/18153993/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/21360535","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/5#issuecomment-21360535","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/5","id":21360535,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxMzYwNTM1","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-07-22T17:23:46Z","updated_at":"2013-07-22T17:23:46Z","body":"@cmungall  Thanks for modeling the interaction types as such. This addresses the original issue. I'll take a stab at using the ontology in an owl exporter as discussed.  When would you like to share your results with Malcolm Storey?
