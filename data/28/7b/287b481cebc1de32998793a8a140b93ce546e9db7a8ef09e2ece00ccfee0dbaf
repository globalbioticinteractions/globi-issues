However, it requires more than just technical frameworks—it demands human-centered collaboration and long-term institutional support. Within Taiwan’s Long-Term Socio-Ecological Research (LTSER) platform, we work closely with individual data contributors to address the practical challenges of standardization, traceability, and data preservation across disciplines.One persistent challenge is the inherent heterogeneity of biodiversity data, spanning diverse ecological, species observation, and socio-cultural contexts, which often hinders seamless cross-domain data integration. To address this, we facilitate the adoption of biodiversity data standards through tools that guide metadata structuring and ensure data quality. This includes a GPT-powered assistant to aid contributors in standard alignment and external toolkits for crucial data cleaning and validation before publication. Through one-on-one consultations, we promote awareness of metadata quality and standard adherence, fostering trust-based engagement vital for harmonizing disparate datasets.For long-term preservation and transparent provenance, we primarily utilize the depositar platform, maintained by Academia Sinica. We support contributors in preparing metadata, assigning persistent ARK identifiers, and aligning with FAIR principles. Crucially, the depositar API enables powerful extensions: data are directly visualized on associated project websites, enhancing accessibility and reusability. Furthermore, the API allows for managing and tracking the progress of data uploads, ensuring timely and consistent submissions while preserving provenance throughout the data lifecycle.These overarching workflows and solutions were not developed in isolation but emerged through continuous dialogue and collaboration between researchers, data managers, and software developers.Our experience highlights the value of hands-on, trust-based support in embedding robust provenance practices into real-world biodiversity data workflows. We offer this work as a practical example of how traceability, interoperability, and transparency can be achieved through ongoing engagement and shared responsibility in a complex socio-ecological context.\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/1111/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/1111/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
