Perhaps there is already information somewhere in the GloBI resources about how to make this calculation?\r\n\r\neventDateUnixEpoch are the seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z or unix's birthday. See also, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time . Mainly a technical trick to store dates as a single number, instead of (lengthy) strings, and to avoid date formatting issues. Most programming languages have an easy way to convert from this number to a date (e.g., javascript's ```console.log(new Date(0))``` produces  ```Date Wed Dec 31 1969 16:00:00 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time)``` (same as  1970-01-01T00:00:00Z ) . \r\n\r\nIn this case, this advantage is lost, because the number is printed as a string and ISO 8601 date format is pretty much standard. Would you prefer to change the eventDateUnixEpoch into eventDate and use ISO 8601 instead?","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/919527104/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/919527599","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/699#issuecomment-919527599","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/699","id":919527599,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACXQt842zuCv","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-14T21:30:54Z","updated_at":"2021-09-14T21:30:54Z","body":"btw -

Specifically, I was trying to convert the\neventDateUnixEpoch column to a date/time format in R. I'm having some\ndifficulty though. Like you said, many programming languages have simple\ncommands to convert the Unix time to a different format. I found 2 ways of\ndoing this in R (both of which give similar results). Here is a webpage\nwhere I found the instructions:\nhttps://www.geeksforgeeks.org/convert-unix-timestamp-to-date-object-in-r/\n\nUsing the as_datetime() function in package lubridate:\n[image: image.png]\n\nUsing the as.POSIXct() function in package lubridate:\n[image: image.png]\n\nAs you can see, the year argument doesn't make any sense. Do you have any\nadvice on the issue here? I also noticed that some values in the\neventDateUnixEpoch column are negative and the date/year conversation also\nappears negative.\n\nThank you for the help!\n\n\n\nOn Tue, Sep 21, 2021 at 5:07 PM Jorrit Poelen ***@***.***>\nwrote:\n\n> hey @Grace89 <https://github.com/Grace89> and @lee-michellej\n> <https://github.com/lee-michellej> and @seltmann\n> <https://github.com/seltmann> did you get a chance to review my questions?\n>\n> —\n> You are receiving this because you were mentioned.\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n> <https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/699#issuecomment-924384183>,\n> or unsubscribe\n> <https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ACMHFZ4PMBQN6NYRDRC7JNDUDDXYHANCNFSM5EBAO24A>\n> .\n> Triage notifications on the go with GitHub Mobile for iOS\n> <https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1477376905?ct=notification-email&mt=8&pt=524675>\n> or Android\n> <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.github.android&referrer=utm_campaign%3Dnotification-email%26utm_medium%3Demail%26utm_source%3Dgithub>.\n>\n>\n\n\n-- \nGraziella Vittoria DiRenzo, PhD\nShe/her/ella\nAssistant Unit Leader of Wildlife\nUnited States Geological Survey\nMassachusetts Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit\nProfessional Website <http://grazielladirenzo.weebly.com>\nGoogle Scholar\n<https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1lCppwIAAAAJ&hl=en>\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/928217946/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/928221282","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/699#issuecomment-928221282","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/699","id":928221282,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACXQt843U4hi","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-27T19:56:17Z","updated_at":"2021-09-27T19:58:14Z","body":"hey @Grace89 thanks for your message.\r\n\r\nWould it help to use ISO8601 date/time format instead of that unix thing? \r\n\r\ne.g., something like: 2021-01-12T12:01... instead of some long number 123456.... . \r\n\r\nIn the meantime, I'd go for using the ```as.POSIXct()``` method. \r\n\r\nAs far as negative numbers go - these are probably dates that happened before 1970 . . .
