This is unlikely.\n\nRoot cause: Specimen originally described as “Grey Smoothhound” was incorrectly classified as The Grey (Hadena caesia), a type of moth. Reason was that species was described with common name “Grey Smoothhound” where a scientific canonical name was expected. The taxon matching algorithm could not find a match for this (common) name, and attempted a search for “Grey”, an assumed genus. This matched against The Grey (Hadena caesia), a moth species. Was found in Hechinger et al 2011 from source at http://www.esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E092/066/. The query at http://tinyurl.com/taxonNameConversion helps to see the original and classified name list for the moth.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/59/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/59/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
