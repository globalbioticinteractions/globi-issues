As fruit is produced by plants, GloBI classified the pathogen taxa to be Plantae. \r\n\r\nSo, it appears that the root cause of this suspicious interaction is the aps dataset produced by Samara (see https://github.com/jhpoelen/samara). Will open a separate issue on that project.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/323127796/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/344327995","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/308#issuecomment-344327995","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/308","id":344327995,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NDMyNzk5NQ==","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-14T17:07:25Z","updated_at":"2017-11-14T17:07:25Z","body":"Just confirmed that the suspicious record no longer exists.
