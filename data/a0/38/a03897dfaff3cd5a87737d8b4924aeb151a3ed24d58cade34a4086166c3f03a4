DOIs - some reference have dois. Did you consider parsing out the dois and add them in a separate column? e.g. reference doi\r\n2. in prey columns you use whitespace ` ` to delimit genus and specific epithet. With the snakes, you use underscores (`_`). I was wondering whether you have a specific reason for the different name notation.\r\n3. is there any specific taxonomy that you are aligning your names with? If so, suggest to include taxon id in addition to the name (if available). E.g., ITIS:174141 is ITIS taxon id associated with Thamnophis cyrtopsis or http://www.itis.gov/servlet/SingleRpt/SingleRpt?search_topic=TSN&search_value=174141 \r\n4. name columns are prefixed with the role of the described organism (e.g., Prey / Snake), however columns Age_Class\tSVL(mm)\tSex do not. Suggest to also prefix these as with names to avoid confusion like: is the ageclass associated with the predator or prey? \r\n\r\nCurious to hear your thoughts.\r\n\r\nand. . . . the dataset should be relatively easy to index by GloBI as is, assuming that the dataset is openly accessible and published as a csv file.
