abstract: |
  Life on Earth is sustained by complex interactions between organisms and their environment. These biotic interactions can be captured in datasets and published digitally. We present a review process of such an openly accessible digital interactions dataset of known origin, and discuss its outcome. The dataset under review, named globalbioticinteractions/OBservData, is 25.3MiB in size and contains 5795 interactions with 1 unique type of association (e.g., pollinatedBy) between 46 primary taxa (e.g., Malus domestica) and 2961 associated taxa (e.g., Apis mellifera). The report includes detailed summaries of interactions data as well as a taxonomic review from multiple catalogs.

# Introduction



## Data Review

Data review can be a time consuming process, especially when done manually. This review report aims to help facilitate data review of species interaction claims made in datasets registered with Global Biotic Interactions [@Poelen_2014]. The review includes summary statistics of, and observations about, the dataset under review:

> Allen-Perkins, Alfonso, Magrach, Ainhoa, Dainese, Matteo, Garibaldi, Lucas A., Kleijn, David, Rader, Romina, Reilly, James R., et al. 2022. "CropPol: A Dynamic, Open and Global Database on Crop Pollination." Ecology 103(3): e3614. https://doi.org/10.1002/ecy.3614 file:///home/runner/work/OBservData/OBservData/./  

For additional metadata related to this dataset, please visit [https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/OBservData](https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/OBservData) and inspect associated metadata files including, but not limited to, _README.md_, _eml.xml_, and/or _globi.json_.

# Methods

The review is performed through programmatic scripts that leverage tools like Preston, Elton, Nomer combined with third-party tools like grep, mlr, tail and head. 

 | tool name | version | 
 | --- | --- | 
 | [elton](httpsmisc://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/elton) | 0.13.8 | 
 | [nomer](https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/nomer) | 0.5.13 |  
 | [mlr](https://miller.readthedocs.io/en/6.8.0/) | 6.0.0 |  
 | [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) | 3.1.6.1 |  
: Tools used in this review process

The review process can be described in the form of the script below ^[Note that you have to first get the data (e.g., via elton pull globalbioticinteractions/OBservData) before being able to generate reviews (e.g., elton review globalbioticinteractions/OBservData), extract interaction claims (e.g., elton interactions globalbioticinteractions/OBservData), or list taxonomic names (e.g., elton names globalbioticinteractions/OBservData)].

~~~
# get versioned copy of the dataset (size approx. 25.3MiB) under review 
elton pull globalbioticinteractions/OBservData

# generate review notes
elton review globalbioticinteractions/OBservData\
 > review.tsv

# export indexed interaction records
elton interactions globalbioticinteractions/OBservData\
 > interactions.tsv

# export names and align them with the Catalogue of Life using Nomer 
elton names globalbioticinteractions/OBservData\
 | nomer append col\
 > name-alignment.tsv
~~~

# Results

In the following sections, the results of the review are summarized [^1]. Then, links to the detailed review reports are provided.

## Biotic Interactions

![Biotic Interaction Data Model](interaction.svg)

In this review, biotic interactions (or biotic associations) are modeled as a primary (aka subject, source) organism interacting with an associate (aka object, target) organism. The dataset under review classified the primary/associate organisms with specific taxa. The primary and associate organisms The kind of interaction is documented as an interaction type. 

The dataset under review, named globalbioticinteractions/OBservData, is 25.3MiB in size and contains 5795 interactions with 1 unique type of association (e.g., pollinatedBy) between 46 primary taxa (e.g., Malus domestica) and 2961 associated taxa (e.g., Apis mellifera).

An exhaustive list of indexed interaction claims can be found in [csv](indexed-interactions.csv) and [tsv](indexed-interactions.tsv) archives. To facilitate discovery, the first 500 claims available on the html page at [indexed-interactions.html](indexed-interactions.html) are shown below.

The exhaustive list was used to create the following data summaries below.

### Interaction Networks

The figures below provide a graph view on the dataset under review. The first shows a summary network on the kingdom level, and the second shows how interactions on the family level. It is important to note that both network graphs were first aligned taxonomically using the Catalogue of Life. Please refer to the original (or verbatim) taxonomic names for a more original view on the interaction data.

: Name relationship types per catalog. Name relationship type "NONE" means that a name was not recognized by the associated catalog. "SAME_AS" indicates either a "HAS_ACCEPTED_NAME" or "SYNONYM_OF" name relationship type. We recognize that "SYNONYM_OF" encompasses many types of nomenclatural synonymies [@ICZN_1999] (e.g., junior synonym, senior synonyms).

## Additional Reviews

Elton, Nomer, and other tools may have difficulties interpreting existing species interaction datasets. Or, they may misbehave, or otherwise show unexpected behavior. As part of the review process, detailed review notes are kept that document possibly misbehaving, or confused, review bots. An sample of review notes associated with this review can be found below.

## GloBI Review Badge

As part of the review, a review badge is generated. This review badge can be included in webpages to indicate the review status of the dataset under review. 

![Picture of a GloBI Review Badge ^[Up-to-date status of the GloBI Review Badge can be retrieved from the [GloBI Review Depot](https://depot.globalbioticinteractions.org/reviews/globalbioticinteractions/OBservData/review.svg)]](review.svg) 

Note that if the badge is green, no review notes were generated. If the badge is yellow, the review bots may need some help with interpreting the species interaction data.

## GloBI Index Badge

If the dataset under review has been [registered with GloBI](https://globalbioticinteractions.org/contribute), and has been succesfully indexed by GloBI, the GloBI Index Status Badge will turn green. This means that the dataset under review was indexed by GloBI and is available through GloBI services and derived data products. 

![Picture of a GloBI Index Badge ^[Up-to-date status of the GloBI Index Badge can be retrieved from [GloBI's API](https://api.globalbioticinteractions.org/interaction.svg?interactionType=ecologicallyRelatedTo&accordingTo=globi:globalbioticinteractions/OBservData&refutes=true&refutes=false)]](https://api.globalbioticinteractions.org/interaction.svg?interactionType=ecologicallyRelatedTo&accordingTo=globi:globalbioticinteractions/OBservData&refutes=true&refutes=false)

# Discussion

This review aims to provide a perspective on the dataset to aid in understanding of species interaction claims discovered. However, it is important to note that this review does *not* assess the quality of the dataset. Instead, it serves as an indication of the open-ness[^2] and FAIRness [@Wilkinson_2016; @trekels_maarten_2023_8176978] of the dataset: to perform this review, the data was likely openly available, **F**indable, **A**ccessible, **I**nteroperable and **R**eusable. The current Open-FAIR assessment is qualitative, and a more quantitative approach can be implemented with specified measurement units. 

This report also showcases the reuse of machine-actionable (meta)data, something highly recommended by the FAIR Data Principles [@Wilkinson_2016]. Making (meta)data machine-actionable enables more precise procesing by computers, enabling even naive review bots like Nomer and Elton to interpret the data effectively. This capability is crucial for not just automating the generation of reports, but also for facilitating seamless data exchanges, promoting interoperability.
