Rev.. https://doi.org/10.1111/mam.12225\" globalbioticinteractions/gryseels2020\r\n```\r\n2. configure column mapping by editing generated [globi.json](https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/gryseels2020/blob/main/globi.json) \r\n3. add configuration files to version control (i.e., ```git init && git add -A && git commit -am 'first commit'``` ) \r\n4. create github repository at https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/gryseels2020 \r\n5. enable automated review via ```travis enable --com``` at https://travis-ci.com/globalbioticinteractions/gryseels2020 \r\n6. introduce interaction type mappings via https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/gryseels2020/blob/main/interaction_types_ignored.csv and https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/gryseels2020/blob/main/interaction_types_mapping.csv .\r\n7. inspect automated review\r\n\r\nSome observations:\r\n\r\n1. SARS-CoV-2 taxonomy was not made explicit in the table, so I had to make it explicit in the index configuration in [globi.json](https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/gryseels2020/blob/main/globi.json) \r\n2. Interaction type mappings are subjective and are mapped to \"hasHost\" http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002454 for all likely susceptible mammals.  Non-susceptible mammals are ignored for now, so you can't lookup mammals that are explicitly found to be not susceptible.\r\n3. merged row cells for order and families in the table 1. do not translate into the exported table, leaving some taxa without higher taxonomic information. \r\n \r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/735905787/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/738185578","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/565#issuecomment-738185578","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/565","id":738185578,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczODE4NTU3OA==","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-03T18:07:54Z","updated_at":"2020-12-03T18:08:46Z","body":"A first pass at Gryseels et al. 2020 has been indexed.
