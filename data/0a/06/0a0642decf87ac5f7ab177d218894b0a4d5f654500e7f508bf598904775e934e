And thanks for sharing your sample data.\r\n\r\nI ran:\r\n```\r\ncurl -L https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/files/8535061/test-names.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\nto retrieve:\r\n``` \r\nCremnops%montrealensis\r\nCremnops%vulgaris\r\nCremnops%californicus\r\nCremnops%desertor\r\n```\r\n\r\nand noticed that added the ```%``` character. If you'd like to escape the whitespace characters manually, you'd have to add ```20``` to complete the escaped whitespace in url land : ```%20``` . I edited your file to do this and created ```test-names-2.txt``` and printed the content to the terminal using:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cat test-names-2.txt \r\nCremnops%20montrealensis\r\nCremnops%20vulgaris\r\nCremnops%20californicus\r\nCremnops%20desertor\r\n```\r\n\r\nnow, I ran the script to get results from globi's web api:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncat test-names-2.txt\\\r\n| sed 's+^+https://api.globalbioticinteractions.org/interaction.csv?sourceTaxon=+g'\\\r\n| xargs -L1 curl\\\r\n> test-names2-interactions.csv\r\n```\r\n\r\nand, in the last three lines (```tail -n3```) of this output file ```test-names2-interactions.csv```, I saw:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cat test-names2-interactions.csv| tail -n3\r\n\"source_taxon_external_id\",\"source_taxon_name\",\"source_taxon_path\",\"source_specimen_occurrence_id\",\"source_specimen_institution_code\",\"source_specimen_collection_code\",\"source_specimen_catalog_number\",\"source_specimen_life_stage\",\"source_specimen_basis_of_record\",\"interaction_type\",\"target_taxon_external_id\",\"target_taxon_name\",\"target_taxon_path\",\"target_specimen_occurrence_id\",\"target_specimen_institution_code\",\"target_specimen_collection_code\",\"target_specimen_catalog_number\",\"target_specimen_life_stage\",\"target_specimen_basis_of_record\",\"latitude\",\"longitude\",\"study_title\"\r\n\"GBIF:1263231\",\"Cremnops desertor\",\"Animalia | Arthropoda | Insecta | Hymenoptera | Braconidae | Cremnops | Cremnops desertor\",,,,,,,\"hasParasite\",\"GBIF:5801103\",\"Perilampus microgastris\",\"Animalia | Arthropoda | Insecta | Hymenoptera | Perilampidae | Perilampus | Perilampus microgastris\",,,,,,,,,\r\n\"GBIF:1263231\",\"Cremnops desertor\",\"Animalia | Arthropoda | Insecta | Hymenoptera | Braconidae | Cremnops | Cremnops desertor\",,,,,,,\"hasParasite\",\"GBIF:5801103\",\"Perilampus microgastris\",\"Animalia | Arthropoda | Insecta | Hymenoptera | Perilampidae | Perilampus | Perilampus microgastris\",,,,,,,,,\r\n```\r\nCurious to see whether this trick also works for you. . . \r\n\r\n\r\n[test-names2-interactions.csv](https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/files/8535474/test-names2-interactions.csv)\r\n[test-names-2.txt](https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/files/8535476/test-names-2.txt)\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/1105826242/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/1105971669","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/782#issuecomment-1105971669","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/782","id":1105971669,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACXQt85B68nV","user":{"login":"EMTuckerLab","id":58006481,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MDA2NDgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/58006481?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EMTuckerLab","html_url":"https://github.com/EMTuckerLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EMTuckerLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EMTuckerLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EMTuckerLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EMTuckerLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EMTuckerLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EMTuckerLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EMTuckerLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EMTuckerLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EMTuckerLab/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-22T03:40:55Z","updated_at":"2022-04-22T03:40:55Z","body":"@jhpoelen\r\nAh ha!
