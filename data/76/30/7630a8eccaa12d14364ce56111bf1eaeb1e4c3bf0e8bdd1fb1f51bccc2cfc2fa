It seems that after the ingestion around May 30th, the citations for specific interactions are missing the reference to the original study, although the data source is listed. For instance, GoMexSI recorded that an atlantic croaker ate anchovies. This association shows up on http://eol.org/pages/994841/data , but the \"data about this record\" does not seem to include the citation of original study used by GoMexSI. ![screen shot 2014-06-05 at 9 55 41 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1084872/3190797/ef860ef4-ecd2-11e3-8c41-bc67fe88ea96.png)\n\nPreviously, the study citation was included (see [blog post](http://globalbioticinteractions.wordpress.com/2014/01/24/what-parasites-do-atlantic-croaker-host-find-it-on-the-encyclopedia-of-life/) )\n. \n\n@jhammock please let me know how I can help re-introduce the study reference into the eol pages.\n\nFrom comment thread on http://eol.org/collections/96806/newsfeed \n\n```\n@Jennifer Hammock: Hey Jen - I poked around a bit and I noticed that the references seem to be hidden. The source is visible (e.g. SPIRE), but specific citations within that source are missing. Is this expected behavior? I am hoping that we can retain the citations within a specific source such that original authors can be attributed. -jorrit \n\n@Jorrit Poelen: hmm... actually I think we're missing some other things too. Check out Aplysia californica. Predators but no prey. I think we have at least two problems. Yet we seem to have about the right number of records (see EOL stats, nearly all interactions data is from GloBI) \n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/72/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/72/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
