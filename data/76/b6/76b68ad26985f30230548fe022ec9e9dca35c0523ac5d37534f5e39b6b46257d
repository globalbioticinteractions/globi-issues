It may be a bit vague term but I think it was best of the possible choices.\r\n\r\n> I re-checked the options available during new nanopub creation. Perhaps \"acquires nutrients from\" is better than more general \"trophically interacts with\", but is still somewhat misleading in my view because, like \"eats\", it implies that the subject acquires something for the object itself and not from a \"product\" of the object. Just in case, we are studying dung beetles that feed on droppings of mammals.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/1840362324/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/1840794255","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/923#issuecomment-1840794255","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/923","id":1840794255,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACXQt85tuEqP","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-12-05T13:28:22Z","updated_at":"2023-12-05T13:28:22Z","body":"@tkuhn thanks for sharing Andrey Frolov's response. \r\n\r\nAs I was reading it, I was wondering whether it would have helped to use \"body part\" as \"feces\" .
