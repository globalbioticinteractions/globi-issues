GloBI has added support for looking up NODC taxon codes v8 (for more info see [NODC Taxonomic Code Version 8.0 on CD-ROM](https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/General/CDR-detdesc/taxonomic-v8.html)) and their associated ITIS taxonomic serial numbers (tsn). This allows GloBI to resolve predator/prey taxa by id, rather than by the provided predator and prey names. \n\nFor a more detailed description on how the data was mapped into GloBI, please see https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/noaa-reem/ . \n\nIf you have any questions / suggestions, please let me know. \n\n-jorrit\n\n![screen shot 2016-04-08 at 9 47 31 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1084872/14391262/d5dd2622-fd6f-11e5-9804-7cd13f87a608.png)\n![screen shot 2016-04-08 at 9 47 11 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1084872/14391263/d5df556e-fd6f-11e5-87d3-0c2ebc71229c.png)\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/207514994/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
