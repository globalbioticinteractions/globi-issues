But I'm wondering if we can set up `glob.json` with the url of the repository (e.g. [`https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.k0q1n`](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.k0q1n)) and then **elton** could fetch data using [Dryad API](https://datadryad.org/api/v2/docs/#/default/get_datasets__doi__download). So, it will always fetch the latest version of the dataset when new version are available.\r\n\r\nI don't know if it is relevant right now, but maybe Dryad can be used in the same way Zenodo and GitHub are used by GloBI.\r\n\r\nShould we also considering [Figshare](https://figshare.com/).\r\n\r\nLet me know what do you think about it, and if I can help with some implementation.\r\n\r\nthanks.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/649/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/649/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
