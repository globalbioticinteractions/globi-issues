And, attributing their contributions is extremely important to sustain this open source/data community for many reasons, including but not limited to: - (a) without attribution the provenance/source of the claim is lost, making the data unsuitable for research purposes for ethical and technical reasons and (b) by crediting the source of each of the claim, contributors can better learn about the impact and reach of their work.\r\n\r\nThis I why I suggest your group:\r\n\r\n1. cite each and every source / authority by including all meta-data/provenance data in the data that you reuse (e.g., data elements referenceCitation, referenceDoi, referenceUrl.sourceCitation, sourceNamespace, sourceArchiveURI, sourceDOI) - this is intended to document where GloBI indexed the data, and how the indexed data attributed source data. Each and every of the millions of interaction claims indexed by GloBI has this information\r\n2. cite GloBI itself as a mediator or indexing service\r\n3. contribute your dataset in the public domain, and let GloBI (and others) index it \r\n4. sponsor financially (e.g., grants, projects, consulting), or materially (e.g., person-hours, server space) GloBI and groups that help contribute species interaction data, taxonomic information, or other relevant open biodiversity data services. Most of the work is funded by the public, and I believe that industry should contribute where they can, especially considering the history of companies' many profits from publicly funded scientific discoveries.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, as mentioned, the data produced by GloBI (facilitated by the thousands of indirect/direct contributors) currently carries a CC-BY license (when applicable) and GloBI software carries a GNU GPL license. \r\n\r\nI hope these comments are helpful and I am curious to hear your thoughts,\r\n\r\n-jorrit","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/1086228840/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/1086643754","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/772#issuecomment-1086643754","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/772","id":1086643754,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACXQt85AxN4q","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-02T13:39:30Z","updated_at":"2022-04-02T13:39:30Z","body":"Also see https://twitter.com/GlobalBiotic/status/1510249824536436742 - \r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nSony Computer Science Laboratory Inc. #SonyCSL @SonyGroupGlobal is doing research on Synecoculture https://doi.org/10.1038/s41538-018-0026-4 .
