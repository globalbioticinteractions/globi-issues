Specifically, I want to create a network of Vespa velutina containing first order and second order interactions. Therefore, I would use the API to download interactions from GloBI. I am experimenting with looping over a list of species and a list of interactions and perform an API per combination (too avoid too high numbers of interactions per download). You can find a draft of my script [here](https://github.com/jrhillae/AlienCSI_VM_JH/blob/bc55eb9c8b2c6a39414970348b67e331d346676e/Iguana's/test.R). It seems to work fine. But I contact you to be sure that it is stable enough and I am not missing any interactions. Also there are some interactions containing website links as source and target, how should I deal with them? Best to visit the website and replace the link with the species name mentioned on the website (if applicable)?\r\n\r\nThe final network would be part of a publication under review, so I want to apply a reliable way to access the GloBI database. Any advice is welcome.\r\n\r\nFor clarity, unique combinations of species source, interactions type and species target are sufficient for the moment to create the network. \r\n\r\nThank you for your help.
