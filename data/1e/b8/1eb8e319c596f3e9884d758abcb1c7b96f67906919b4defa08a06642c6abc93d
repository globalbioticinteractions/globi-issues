I noticed that the expected food item red rock crab ([_Cancer productus_](http://eol.org/pages/317369/overview)) did not appear as expected on eol data page for the otter.\n\nI checked the darwin core taxa export and found this line:\n\n```\n\"taxonID\",\"scientificName\",\"parentNameUsageID\",\"kingdom\",\"phylum\",\"class\",\"order\",\"family\",\"genus\",\"taxonRank\",\"furtherInformationURL\",\"taxonomicStatus\",\"taxonRemarks\",\"namePublishedIn\",\"referenceID\"\n...\nEOL:1251487,Enhydra lutris nereis,,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Carnivora,Mustelidae,Enhydra,Infraspecies,http://eol.org/pages/1251487,,,,\n```\n\nFor some reason, the ingestion by EOL seem to have lost to (infra) species level info, because the interaction appears on the [Enhydra](http://eol.org/pages/34543/overview) genus page. Note that no darwin core taxon term seems to exist for species rank (see http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/#taxonindex).\n\nIs this a known issue on darwin core taxa ingestion? If so, how can we make sure that the link to the infraspecies is made on eol?\n","closed_by":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/114/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/114/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
