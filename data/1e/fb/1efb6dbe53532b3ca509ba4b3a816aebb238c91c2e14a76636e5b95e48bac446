Moreover, there are no human-readable labels available in the SPARQL endpoint, hampering querying (since various different taxon IDs are used). \r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/963/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/963/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
