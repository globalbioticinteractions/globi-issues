so, turns out that GloBI is indexing habitat fields only if there's some kind of interaction type specified. If indexing the habitat field by default with some default interactions, many false positives are found. \r\n\r\nFor history and example of the habitat indexing, see https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/684 .\r\n\r\nSo, I see a couple of options:\r\n\r\n1. introduce configuration to have habitat field be interpreted as associatedTaxa (only for inhs insects) - \r\n2. get inhs insects collection to provide explicit interaction type in the habitat fields (e.g., on: Homo sapiens, ex: Homo sapiens, visits: Plantus minus)\r\n\r\nWhat do you prefer? Am open to other alternatives. . . would be a bummer to have this valuable association data be hidden in plain sight . . .
