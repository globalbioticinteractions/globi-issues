If there is an updated version somewhere else, please let me know.\r\n\r\nAs you noticed, few folks ever get to encode bodypart / lifestage / physiological state . . . and I am glad you to it! Finally a reason to develop this more. So, body-part-mapping.csv you pointed to is the default (sparse) mapping that GloBI has - happy to update / merge pull requests on this.  \r\n\r\n> I am not sure if this whole exercise is useful at all for globi, but thought I will share. Maybe there is already something obvious in the globi repo, which I have missed. If so, please let me know - this will help me guide my efforts better.\r\n\r\nI hope that your efforts will help make the associated GloBI resources a little more useful. One way to do this, is to take your list and turn it into the new default by replacing the hard-coded body-part-mapping.csv . Please let me know if you have any other ideas. \r\n\r\nHope this helps, and curious to hear your thoughts!","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/2546054821/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/2547789292","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/1031#issuecomment-2547789292","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/1031","id":2547789292,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACXQt86X3C3s","user":{"login":"mdrishti","id":49712124,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NzEyMTI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49712124?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdrishti","html_url":"https://github.com/mdrishti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdrishti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdrishti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdrishti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdrishti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdrishti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdrishti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdrishti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdrishti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdrishti/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-12-17T08:26:05Z","updated_at":"2024-12-17T08:40:15Z","body":"@jhpoelen, Happy to encode the bodypart / lifestage / physiological states!\r\n>\r\n> I hope that your efforts will help make the associated GloBI resources a little more useful.

Please let me know if you have any other ideas.\r\n> \r\nYes, the original body-part-mapping.csv could be updated with the new file. I can format the latter according to the columns from the former, if required. Do you use a python dictionary like structure to perform the body parts/life stage mappings? In this case, one can just change the column names for key-value pairs. If you can guide me to the code where the dictionary is initialized, I can make the changes. I will create the pull request accordingly with the file replacement and code changes.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/2547789292/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/2552569495","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/1031#issuecomment-2552569495","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/1031","id":2552569495,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACXQt86YJR6X","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-12-19T01:11:59Z","updated_at":"2024-12-19T01:11:59Z","body":"hey @mdrishti - preparing a pull request would be great! \r\n\r\nPlease see https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/blob/973066bd7fc7d5d722cced4da5ae4dfd2c562e1c/eol-globi-taxon-resolver/src/main/java/org/eol/globi/taxon/UberonLookupService.java for usage of the default lookup / translation tables.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you need more information . . .
