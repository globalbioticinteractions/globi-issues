But at some level it makes sense to store this some other way. For example, the first interaction here:\n\nhttp://www.bioinfo.org.uk/html/Trichogramma_brassicae.htm\nhttp://www.bioinfo.org.uk/html/b149795.htm\n\nwhich is actually a causal chain of interactions - the initial mating (within the same species), the following and hitchhiking interaction, and finally the parasiting of the offspring. The first maybe isn't in scope for globi but might be nice to capture one day. For the subsequent two, I don't know from the bioinfo dataset if you would only be able to capture one of these. I would try and capture the more specific nuances using a behavior term (e.g. following pheromone trail), and use relationships at a broader level. There are a few candidates for behavior terms here - NBO covers all animals, but is not actively maintained. However, if we can do a focused set for illustrative purposes I would use the social insect behavior ontology, perhaps generalizing to all insects - https://github.com/obophenotype/sibo\n\nSuzi is @selewis\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/100379123/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/100386459","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/137#issuecomment-100386459","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/137","id":100386459,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwMDM4NjQ1OQ==","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-08T22:34:59Z","updated_at":"2015-05-08T22:34:59Z","body":"@cmungall should be easy to add new mappings in the future. Perhaps we can focus on species interactions that are relatively straight forward and commonly used (e.g. ecto/endo/klepto-parasitism). Also I could definitely benefit from a second pair of eyes on this. Also shouldn't http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002444 be a trophic interaction?
