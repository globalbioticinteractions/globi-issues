I tried to read the csv as UTF-8 and found that some of the special characters in the source references looked funny. E.g., ```Zamani, Navid, et al. \"Predation of montane deserts ungulates by Asiatic cheetah Acinonyx jubatus venaticus in Central Iran.\"�Folia Zoologica�66.1 (2017): 50-57.``` . Note the �'s.\r\n2. for columns ```scientificNamePrey``` and ```scientificNameCarni```, underscores are used to connect the genus and specific epithet. However, in other fields like ```commonNamePrey``` whitespaces are used. Is there a specific reason for including the underscore?\r\n3. for the primary sources, you parsed out the author, year, title and journal. Would you happen to have associated DOIs? \r\n\r\nI have some other questions, but these are the ones that were on the top of the list. \r\n\r\nThanks for compiling and sharing such a rich resource on carnivore diets,\r\n\r\n-jorrit\r\n\r\nPS I created a configuration for CarniDIET to be indexed by GloBI (Global Biotic Interactions) at https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/CarniDIET-Database . Would you be interested in a pull request to add globi.json (GloBI's config file) to your main repository?\r\n\r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/813560251/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/814038012","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/642#issuecomment-814038012","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/642","id":814038012,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxNDAzODAxMg==","user":{"login":"osmiddleton","id":34517014,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NTE3MDE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34517014?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/osmiddleton","html_url":"https://github.com/osmiddleton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osmiddleton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osmiddleton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osmiddleton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osmiddleton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osmiddleton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osmiddleton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osmiddleton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osmiddleton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osmiddleton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-06T11:15:31Z","updated_at":"2021-04-06T11:15:31Z","body":"Hi Jorrit, \r\n\r\nThanks for getting in touch about CarniDIET and glad you're interested in it.\r\n\r\n1.\tThe character encoding is currently ANSI. The � in the example highlighted should just be whitespaces so I’m surprised to see them appear.\r\n2.\tSpecies scientific names have an underscore to make it directly relatable to the PHYLACINE database (https://github.com/MegaPast2Future/PHYLACINE_1.2).
