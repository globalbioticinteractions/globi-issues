Currently, the database hold 9,570 predation records from 32 of the 35 species of garter snakes. This database will be a part of a publication within the coming months, and I am hoping to make the data accessibel through GloBI upon publishing. Since the data is already in a .csv file, is there a way to prepapre this file for public access upon publishing? Or, will I need to change its format to match the interaction.tsv file example you have provided on the github template page?
