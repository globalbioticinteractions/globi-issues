So we don't have to built it programmatically.\n\n4) We could map interaction type names in frontend to fit user's purpose. This would lead to changes whenever new interaction types are added to the database.\n\nI prefer 2) \n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/139135843/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/145582469","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/166#issuecomment-145582469","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/166","id":145582469,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NTU4MjQ2OQ==","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-05T16:02:19Z","updated_at":"2015-10-05T16:02:19Z","body":"@coding46 (apologies for a late reply) if I add the 3) label , would you be able to easily apply the change to use that label?\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/145582469/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/145582992","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/166#issuecomment-145582992","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/166","id":145582992,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NTU4Mjk5Mg==","user":{"login":"cmungall","id":50745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmungall","html_url":"https://github.com/cmungall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmungall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmungall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmungall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmungall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmungall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmungall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmungall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmungall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmungall/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-05T16:03:50Z","updated_at":"2015-10-05T16:03:50Z","body":"I can add these to RO, and add explicit inverses.
