After taking a closer look, it appears that the site, run by Cristian Solari (see https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Cristian_Solari) et al.,  help to mobilize communities to describe species interactions. So, the project aligns with part of GloBI's mission to help make existing species interaction data accessible in that interactions can be added (after registration) in the form of \"cases\". Also, it seems that most species interaction records (except for 121 \"cases\") on the site are sourced from datasets indexed by GloBI. \r\n\r\nThe website claims the database is \"free\" but, for some reason, the terms and conditions do not appear to align with open data/ open source ideas (e.g., \"Any other use and/or reproduction of such content, without the prior written consent of speciesconnect.com, is prohibited and will constitute a breach of these Terms of Use.\" accessed at https://speciesconnect.com/about/ on 2020-01-04). \r\n\r\nHoping to establish contact and explore ways that GloBI <> speciesconnect.com can collaborate, specifically related to:\r\n\r\n1. syncing up update mechanisms to make sure that speciesconnect can benefit from up-to-date information\r\n2. figuring out a way to sure that imported GloBI interactions mention the original data sources and references instead of a generic \"source: https://globalbioticinteractions.org\" \r\n3. prototyping ways for GloBI to index the \"cases\" shared via the speciesconnect.com platform.\r\n\r\nI've included some screenshots of the site for reference.\r\n\r\nhttps://speciesconnect.com appears to be hosted using wordpress site/plugins at http://dattaweb.com.ar/ (Argentina).\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2021-01-04 08-40-24](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1084872/103558496-aab0ff80-4eac-11eb-9972-604e84cf9547.png)\r\n![Screenshot from 2021-01-04 08-40-13](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1084872/103558510-b0a6e080-4eac-11eb-8b07-459241274bd4.png)\r\n![Screenshot from 2021-01-04 08-37-55](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1084872/103558531-b6042b00-4eac-11eb-9e19-e916f3d08fa3.png)\r\n![Screenshot from 2021-01-04 08-37-21](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1084872/103558533-b7355800-4eac-11eb-97ed-af6d867068da.png)\r\n![Screenshot from 2021-01-04 08-36-12](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1084872/103558536-b8668500-4eac-11eb-935d-03a95d294acd.png)\r\n![Screenshot from 2021-01-04 08-35-53](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1084872/103558543-bbfa0c00-4eac-11eb-8bbd-375ea1aca708.png)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/582/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/582/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
