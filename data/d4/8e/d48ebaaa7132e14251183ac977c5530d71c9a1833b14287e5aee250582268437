It's not very elegant. Would be better to use the DOIs and links to sources more actively.\r\nJust SO MANY layers of information\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently, GloBI provides citations for the origin of the dataset (where did the data come from) as well as the reference to the claim (who said it). However, when many data sources are included in some (research) application, the citation lists quickly become hard to manage without using specialized data provenance tools.\r\n\r\nSuggest to introduce a method in GloBI to help summarize, and make machine readable, collections of (data) citations and associated claims using methods like nanopubs @tkuhn (https://nanopub.org), reliably referenced provenance logs @mielliott (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2020.101132) , and/or location agnostic content identifiers @cboettig (https://github.com/cboettig/contentid , https://www.dataone.org/webinars/iterative-forecasts/) .  \r\n![Screenshot from 2020-11-06 08-16-10](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1084872/98390646-864eb900-200a-11eb-912a-99cea1b565ec.png)\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/557/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/557/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
