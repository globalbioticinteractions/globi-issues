I don't know about any standardized notation for depth range. Rather than having a single notation for the full depth range, the OBIS API for example has two seperate parameters 'startdepth' and 'enddepth' (start = from shallow, to stop = deeper water). If only a single depth is known I think only the 'startdepth' is used, and 'enddepth' empty or NA or something.\r\n\r\nYou ask a very good question... I think 3D positioning of an organism/interaction somewhere in the world can be made very complex. In my mind, **elevation** is the position of land in reference to sealevel. **Depth** in contrast, is the distance from the surface of a body of water to a position in that body of water, which does not necessarily have to be the bottom. Then you could also have a variable 'meters above bottom (**MAB**)' to indicate the heigt above (or below) land/seafloor.\r\n\r\nJust to illustrate the complexity, let's take the following examples:\r\n1. A sheep on a 50 m hill.\r\n2. A fish at 5 m depth in a 15 m deep lake on the 50 m tall hill.\r\n3. A bird flying at a height of 10 m above the 50 m tall hill.\r\n4. A rabbit living in a hole at 1 m depth in the 50 m tall hill\r\n5. Coral living on a 200m deep seamount.\r\n6. Tuna swimming at 50 m depth above the 200m deep seamount.\r\n7. A deep-sea bacterium living 5 m deep in the subsurface sediments at 3000 m.\r\n\r\nInteraction   | Elevation | Depth | MAB\r\nSheep       | 50           | NA      | 0    > pretty straight forward\r\nLake fish  | 50*           | 5        |  10 > * or 35? because technically the bottom of the lake is 15 meters into the hill...?\r\nBird          | 50            | NA      | 10\r\nRabbit      | 50            | NA     | -1\r\nCoral        | -200        | 200    | 0\r\nTuna         | -200*      | 50     | 150 > * pretty big diff between seabed elevation and tuna position, might be confusing\r\nBacterium | 3000      | 3000* | -5 > * or 3005 m?\r\n\r\nNot sure if such detailed implementation of the 3D location is necessary for this specific database. If I'm thinking about how I personally would use the database, I would like to be able to easily filter organisms living at a certain depth and I would like to know if they are living on the seafloor or free living in the water column. I have never worked with mountain lakes to be honest, but looking at some scientific papers it is pretty common to report altitude and depth, so I guess it must be useful to be able to include both.\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/718215272/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/724099375","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/547#issuecomment-724099375","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/547","id":724099375,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyNDA5OTM3NQ==","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-09T15:51:41Z","updated_at":"2020-11-09T15:51:41Z","body":"@dswdejonge thanks for your example and for exploring the various ways to support depth and elevation/altitude parameters! \r\n\r\nI'll try and make an effort to implement the depth parameter, and I can see how depth ranges can be quite useful.
