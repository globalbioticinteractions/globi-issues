I extracted the attached dataset [Drosophila_Q17392902.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18768007/Drosophila_Q17392902.txt), where I see that _Drosophila_ has been matched to both genuses (see 2 wikidata Ids under column header source/target 'TaxonIds'). Couple of questions:\n\na) How are these names matched? Here  (https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/wiki/Taxonomy-Matching), I see it is only by strict/fuzzy 'TaxonName' matching, but does GloBI takes into account the source/target 'TaxonId' submitted at the source, from where the data is extracted?\n\nb) Is it possible to limit the matching only if the higher order names (phylum/kingdom) also match in context? For example, in the attached dataset, in many rows, _Drosophila_'s phylum name is listed as Fungi, which means it should be matched to the genus of Fungi and not Arthropoda, whereas some records list both Arthropoda and Fungi wikidata Ids.\n\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/1044/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/1044/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
