I am using the 'interactions.tsv.gz' file from the globi website (https://www.globalbioticinteractions.org/data). I was testing some use-cases where such an integration could be useful for agriculture and push-pull mechanism stood out amongst others. But, when I try to find interactions specific to push-pull mechanism, I was able to find some like parasitoidOf, parasiteOf and hasHost, but not amongst the species I was expecting like _Desmodium_ and _Striga_. For instance, this paper has information on the specific interaction between these two species (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031942215300376). There are many papers reporting the same observation like: \r\n\r\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031942215300376\r\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261219406000329\r\nhttps://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ps.6261\r\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261219417300844?via%3Dihub\r\n\r\nMaybe, there is some obvious interaction name that I am missing here. I was looking through the RO properties for something like \"inhibits\" or something in diseases relationships, but didn't find anything suitable to describe this interaction.\r\n\r\nI think it would be great if globi could include such interactions. I could also help in curating information on this, but I am not really sure how to do that. I would appreciate any help in this direction.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nDisha","closed_by":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/993/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/993/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
