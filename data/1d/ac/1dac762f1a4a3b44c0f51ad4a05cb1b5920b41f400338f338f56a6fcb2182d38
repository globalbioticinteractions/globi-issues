I have a dataset with congeneric butterflyfish encounters (>5000) and whether they are passive or aggressive, and butterflyfish feeding data (on scleractinian corals). They have been used in 2 papers so far https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-018-0314-7 ; https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2022.2158. I have just come across GloBI and thought it might be possible to share the data on there but don't have enough time to figure out how to share (I had quick look Zenodo!). Can you help?
