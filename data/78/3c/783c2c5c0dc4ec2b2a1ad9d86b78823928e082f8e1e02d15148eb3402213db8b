There are certain terms that we do have in common, but in some cases they are utilizing them differently.  I don't know how to tackle this.  I think the time and effort to try to conform completely to Darwin Core may not be possible at this time.  Looking at what they have done, it appears to be a daunting task that really would require some experts and a lot time to do.  The Darwin Core seems to be specifically for taxonomic collections.  I will continue to study it but I would like a Darwin Core expert to look at our data categories and comment or make suggestions before we go any further.  They may see it in a different light than I do.\n\nI was once part of an effort to transform the CF database to an SQL database and that took an SQL expert and a number of CF biologists in a room together going through item by item on how to convert or group or whatever was necessary to make the conversion, and it took a number of sessions to complete.\n","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/28508588/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/28510342","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/16#issuecomment-28510342","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/16","id":28510342,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NTEwMzQy","user":{"login":"jhammock","id":3026567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMjY1Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3026567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhammock","html_url":"https://github.com/jhammock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhammock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhammock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhammock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhammock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhammock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhammock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhammock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhammock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhammock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-11-14T18:41:16Z","updated_at":"2013-11-14T18:41:43Z","body":"Hi, Jim!

Although the data format is pretty self explanatory, I'd be happy to spend some time with you to help understand the format that the EOL team has formulated. . . actually . . . this is perfect timing to make suggestions for changes / enhancement since the format is still very much evolving.  Having two separate formats is sometimes pragmatic (but somewhat expensive in the long term), but I think we should at least understand the differences between the two by answering the questions: a) how does the one format translate to the other? and b) what is lost in translation? .
