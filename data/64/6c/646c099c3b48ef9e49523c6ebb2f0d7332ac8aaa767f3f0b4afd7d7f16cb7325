Very neat to see this wealth of research done on how some plants inhibit the growth of others, and I hope that we can figure out a way to let GloBI index this valuable information.\r\n\r\nAnd . . . it would be great if you could help curate this data. Perhaps you can follow the example by Stephen Fowler in https://www.globalbioticinteractions.org/2020/08/25/extracting-parasite-interaction-data/ . If their structure suits your needs to transcribe the relationships, then I'd suggest to copy their example and make transcribe some interactions from existing papers. I'd be happy to review and make sure that the data gets indexed by GloBI.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to use other mechanisms to curate the interaction data extracted from the papers you mention, I'd suggest to have a look at https://globalbioticinteractions.org/contribute and https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/template-dataset .  In my mind, whenever the data is (semi) structured, digital and openly accessible, GloBI should be able to index it.\r\n\r\n@mdrishti Please let me know how you'd like to proceed.\r\n\r\n@diatomsRcool @cmungall @cooperl09\r\n In your work on (plant) disease ontologies in specific and relation ontology in general, have you come across a good way to describe observations like:\r\n\r\n```bibtex\r\n @article{Hooper_2015, title={Isolation and identification of Desmodium root exudates from drought tolerant species used as intercrops against Striga hermonthica}, volume={117}, ISSN={0031-9422}, url={http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2015.06.026}, DOI={10.1016/j.phytochem.2015.06.026}, journal={Phytochemistry}, publisher={Elsevier BV}, author={Hooper, A.M. and Caulfield, J.C. and Hao, B. and Pickett, J.A. and Midega, C.A.O. and Khan, Z.R.}, year={2015}, month=sep, pages={380–387} }\r\n```\r\n\r\n```[...] Plants from the genus Desmodium, in particular D. uncinatum, are used on sub-Saharan small-holder farms as intercrops to inhibit parasitism of cereal crops by Striga hermonthica and Striga asiatica via an allelopathic mechanism.

But, I also see the extra 22 inverse interactions. While in some cases like (rootparasiteOf, hasParasite) makes sense, in others like (allelopathOf, hasPathogen) makes me curious. Particularly, allelopathOf can have several inverse interactions. In case of pushPull, there are 3 that I identified : kills, providesNutrientsFor, hostOf; infact a fourth one is allelopathOf itself (it is not exactly a symbiotic interaction, but allelopathy between two species). \r\n\r\nI am curious about how GloBI infers inverse interactions. I could see that here eol-globi-lib/src/main/java/org/eol/globi/domain/InteractTypeUtil.java, it appears to be coded. But, is there an option to assign multiple inverse interactions. The other option could be that I add the inverse interactions in the original dataset.
