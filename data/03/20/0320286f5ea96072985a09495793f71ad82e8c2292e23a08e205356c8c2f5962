In general, it has been a great resource and is very interesting to explore. Last night (Wednesday, April 3rd) my program received data it couldn’t decode automatically as JSON. Upon investigation, the bad data was a Cloudflare page alerting me to a server error:\r\n![image](https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/assets/45737196/064a4bd6-7039-439e-8ccd-305d6651f51e)\r\n\r\nIt is clear that some API responses are still in Cloudflare’s cache, but seemingly all new queries are not functioning. For example, the Apis mellifera example query on the GloBI homepage still returns data. \r\n\r\n(the above is a copy of an email I sent to @jhpoelen)","closed_by":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/979/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/979/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
