In how far do you want to include interactions at higher taxonomic levels? Probably yes, but then...\r\n2. In how far do you want to do so if the study's focus is not really interactions? For the example figure there are no more in depth references, it's done by very experienced nematologists though. Generally it's hard (or even impossible) to have evidence that all species in a group have a particular interaction.\r\n\r\nI would argue that at higher tanonomic levels an interactions can be only regarded circumstantial evidence. Thus needs to be tested by e.g. ancestral state reconstructions from species level interactions (what @majuss and @irallia do). Would it be possible to add something like \"evidence level\" to GloBI?\r\n\r\nThen at some point one could also add interactions we infer with a particular evidence level \"inferred from phylogeny\" or similar. Gene Ontology uses a set of ontology terms in that sense e.g. http://www.geneontology.org/page/guide-go-evidence-codes maybe something similar exists in more general ontologies that could be used in GloBI?!\r\n\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/325192755/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/325209226","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/306#issuecomment-325209226","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/306","id":325209226,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyNTIwOTIyNg==","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-27T16:33:53Z","updated_at":"2017-08-27T16:35:41Z","body":"Thanks for sharing your thoughts on this! \r\n\r\nRe: 1. higher taxonomic levels - I am inclined to include higher order taxonomic levels, not just because to fill reported interaction gaps, but also to allow for flexible modeling of taxonomic accuracy and precision of interactions. \r\n\r\nRe: 2. non-interaction studies containing interaction data - as long as provenance is clear and allow for modeling of necessary information chunks that help filter datasets according to research / data needs. GloBI has some support for https://terms.tdwg.org/wiki/dwc:basisOfRecord, and, as always, I am sure that improvements can be made to better document the evidence type/level. Actually there is a pre-existing issue to map basisOfRecord to evidence ontology / GO evidence codes see #201.  Please comment on that issue or submit a separate issue to discuss possible usage of GO evidence codes. At a glance, it does appear that these GO codes might be a little more clearly defined. . . \r\n\r\n ","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/325209226/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/325783292","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/306#issuecomment-325783292","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/306","id":325783292,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyNTc4MzI5Mg==","user":{"login":"derele","id":145716,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NTcxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/145716?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/derele","html_url":"https://github.com/derele","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derele/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derele/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derele/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derele/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derele/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derele/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derele/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derele/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derele/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-29T20:03:06Z","updated_at":"2017-08-29T20:04:31Z","body":"Thanks for that insight @jhpoelen!\r\n\r\nI had not noticed basisOfRecord.
