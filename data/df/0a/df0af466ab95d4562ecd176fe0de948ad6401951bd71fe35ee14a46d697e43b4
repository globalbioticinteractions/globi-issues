These part records are used to identify records to catalog as separate records in the parasite collection depending on research activities, staff availability, and funding. In many cases, the host (usually mammal in this case) collection loans the parasite parts out to researchers, which then return with identifications and are subsequently cataloged in the parasite collections with appropriate reciprocal relationships and shared collecting events with their hosts. This is why there are interactions discoverable in part names. At any given point in time, there will be parts  in the host collection that are not yet cataloged in the parasite collection, although the ideal is to eventually do so as funding and resources become available.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/2168125631/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
