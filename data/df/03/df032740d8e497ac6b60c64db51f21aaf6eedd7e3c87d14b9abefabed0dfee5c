In my current research, I study the interaction between whole genome duplication and the pollination niche across many plant-pollinator networks. It seems that the GLOBI resource could be especially useful for our purpose. Specifically, I need to download all plant-pollinator networks data . I succeeded in downloading the data from the browse tab in the online GLOBI server. The downloaded file contained 4096 entries obtained from 56 unique studies (column name is \"study_citation\").\r\nCould you please let me know if this covers all plant-pollinator networks that exist in the GLOBI database? I  would greatly appreciate your response.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nMichal","closed_by":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/456/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/456/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
