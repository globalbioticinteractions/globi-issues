Many links are wrong, at least because the whole information hasn't been reported. It seems you do not include lifestages in your database which is crucial when you consider ontogenetic diet shift.\r\nFor instance, the data base reports that \"sprat is feeding on cod\" which is only true if you say that \"sprat is feeding on the EGGS and LARVAE of cod\".\r\nIf you check the reference cited with the link, it is even written in the title:\r\nKoester, F.W. 1992. Predation by herring and sprat on **cod eggs and larvae** in the Bornholm Basin \r\n\r\nIf you want to build a food web, you will essentially take this information into account and it has become a hassle to check all the information collected from Globi... which can be a lot of links.\r\nSame happens with links someone reported from the DAPSTOM database. All the lifestages informations are missing and it is highly misleading.\r\n\r\nOne of the problem might come from the variety of ways people report such links (e.g. \"Cod larvae\", \"Cod (larvae)\" \"Cod_larvae\" or as extra columns in their own datasets). This variety exists in Globi.\r\n\r\nIf you add two extra columns lifestage_predator and lifestage_prey with already formatted info (e.g. \"larvae\", \"egg\", \"juvenile\", \"adult\"), people will have to stick to this format. Quick fix but still need a check.","closed_by":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/378/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/378/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
