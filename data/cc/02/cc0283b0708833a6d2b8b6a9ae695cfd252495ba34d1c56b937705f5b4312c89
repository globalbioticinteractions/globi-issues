The list is far from complete (it \"only\" includes taxa occurring in GloBI), but hey, it is a start. Hopefully, we can figure out a way to make this (or comparable archive) more comprehensive.\n\n@jhammock let me know what I can do to help convince folks to provide all of EOL taxa in taxa.csv.gz format (or similar)? I'll use taxa.csv.gz as a starting point for https://github.com/jhpoelen/effechecka for now.\n\n@dimus - is there a way to convince you to publish global names in a similar format? \n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/137176442/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/176310514","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/70#issuecomment-176310514","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/70","id":176310514,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3NjMxMDUxNA==","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-28T18:08:08Z","updated_at":"2016-01-28T18:08:08Z","body":"related issue https://github.com/jhpoelen/eol-globi-data/issues/145\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/176310514/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
