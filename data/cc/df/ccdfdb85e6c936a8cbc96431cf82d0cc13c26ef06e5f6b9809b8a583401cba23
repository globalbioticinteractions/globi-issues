Perhaps @timrobertson100 or @dschigel have some ideas about this.\r\n\r\n----\r\nHi!\r\n\r\nI am writing to request the creation of a public mailing list for Global Biotic Interactions (GloBI) on the GBIF listserv. Suggested name would be \"GloBI\".\r\n\r\nI think that having a GloBI mailing list on existing GBIF mailing list infrastructure would work towards your goal as published in Final Report of the Task Group on GBIF Data Fitness for Use in Distribution Modelling Version 1.1 published on 22 March 2016 (see http://www.gbif.org/resource/82612). From page 17 -\r\n\r\n\"Even if comprehensive documentation of the biotic interactions that are established among organisms on Earth is beyond current capabilities, existing data on biotic\r\ninteractions should be linked to trait, distribution, and phylogenetic databases to enable training of the models and testing of their inferences. Initiatives such as Globis\r\n20 (Poelen et al. 2014) or the Web of Life 21, that record primary observations of interactions between individuals of different species in different parts of the world, should be linked with and\r\nintegrated within major biodiversity data portals.\"\r\n\r\nIn my experience, sharing communication channels stimulates the exchange of ideas and facilitates collaboration. Co-hosting a mailing list would be an excellent first step.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know what I can do to make this happen.\r\n\r\nthx,\r\n-jorrit\r\n\r\nGlobal Biotic Interactions\r\nhttps://globalbioticinteractions.org\r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/352206348/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/352492315","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/329#issuecomment-352492315","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/329","id":352492315,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1MjQ5MjMxNQ==","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-18T17:13:57Z","updated_at":"2017-12-18T17:13:57Z","body":"Thanks to GBIF team , GloBI now has a mailing list for help, sharing ideas, discussion and announcement at -\r\n\r\nhttps://lists.gbif.org\r\n\r\nhttps://lists.gbif.org/mailman/listinfo/globi\r\n\r\nHopefully, this will make it easier to ask questions and share ideas.
