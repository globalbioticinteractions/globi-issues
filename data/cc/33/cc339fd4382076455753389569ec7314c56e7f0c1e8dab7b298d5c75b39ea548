suspicious interaction records claiming that Anagrus are parasites of Vitis vinifera are explicitly stated in the NHM London's Interactions Bank, while @bonushenricus and pages like http://www.agri.huji.ac.il/mepests/enemy/Anagrus_atomus/ claim that Anagrus are in fact parasitoids of wine grape parasites (e.g., leafhoppers). This makes the Anagrus sp. suited for biopesticides as suggested in http://www.agri.huji.ac.il/mepests/enemy/Anagrus_atomus/ (accessed 2021-08-16) - \r\n\r\n`\r\n[...] Anagrus atomus is an important enemy of several pestiferous leafhoppers, whose parasitization rates may at times come to 70% or more. In Turkey it effectively controlled leafhoppers that infested corn (maize), parasitization rates at times being >90%; similar controlling rates of another leafhopper were reported from Switzerland. In Europe A. atomus is mass-reared and sold as a biopesticide, usually suppled as pupae, and placed around leafhoppers infestations. \r\n[...]\r\n`\r\n\r\nPerhaps we can ask @edwbaker Ed Baker of the Natural History Museum, London to learn more about these claims. \r\n\r\nIn addition, we can publish specific refutation records that document your disagreement with the claims that the NHM London's Interactions Bank is making. If you'd like to pursue this, please have a look at a refutation dataset like: https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/refuted-interaction-data \r\n\r\nPlease let me know how you'd like to proceed.\r\n\r\n[4858d11fc47f38bae2e439272d9bdccb866084f71dbc66d328e881c01acf857d.gz](https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/files/6994444/4858d11fc47f38bae2e439272d9bdccb866084f71dbc66d328e881c01acf857d.gz)\r\n ","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/899712426/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/902181644","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/689#issuecomment-902181644","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/689","id":902181644,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACXQt841xjMM","user":{"login":"bonushenricus","id":62553299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNTUzMjk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62553299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bonushenricus","html_url":"https://github.com/bonushenricus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bonushenricus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bonushenricus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bonushenricus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bonushenricus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bonushenricus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bonushenricus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bonushenricus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bonushenricus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bonushenricus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-19T19:28:01Z","updated_at":"2021-08-19T19:28:01Z","body":"Ottimo e grazie (excellent and thanks) Jorrit\r\nI think it's okay to ask @edwbaker\r\nbecause the Anagrus atomus is just one example among many\r\nso they should double-check how they compiled the datasets\r\namong other things, they are transcription errors internal to their own organization: as I demonstrated in the Universal Chalcidoidea Database (the original database) the excellent Noyes entered the interaction data correctly.\r\nBut in the transition to the datasets of the whole Natural History Museum some superficialities have been made, in my opinion.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/902181644/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/902338259","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/689#issuecomment-902338259","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/689","id":902338259,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACXQt841yJbT","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-20T00:22:01Z","updated_at":"2021-08-20T00:22:01Z","body":"@bonushenricus thanks for your message.\r\n\r\nI wish there was an easy way to index the Universal Chalcidoidea Database directly.\r\n\r\nAnd, I like your idea to work with @edwbaker  (see also https://www.nhm.ac.uk/our-science/departments-and-staff/staff-directory/ed-baker.html ).
