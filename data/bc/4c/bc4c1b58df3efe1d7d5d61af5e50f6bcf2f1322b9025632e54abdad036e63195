Neat to see how the [COL Data Package (ColDP) Specification 1.0[(https://github.com/CatalogueOfLife/coldp#col-data-package-coldp-specification-10) was partly inspired by the Relations Ontology and GloBI inspired their table design. \r\n\r\nfyi https://github.com/CatalogueOfLife @mdoering  @gdower @vijaybarve @olafbanki @NicBailly\r\n\r\nSuggest to have GloBI index species interaction record in the Catalogue of Life. \r\n\r\nfrom https://github.com/CatalogueOfLife/coldp/blob/master/README.md#speciesinteraction - \r\n\r\n---\r\n[...]\r\nSpeciesInteraction\r\n\r\nA directed taxon relation representing species interactions. Different to a [TaxonConceptRelation](https://github.com/CatalogueOfLife/coldp/blob/master/README.md#taxonconceptrelation)[](https://github.com/CatalogueOfLife/coldp/blob/master/README.md#taxonid-2)[](https://github.com/CatalogueOfLife/coldp/blob/master/README.md#relatedtaxonid-1)[](https://github.com/CatalogueOfLife/coldp/blob/master/README.md#sourceid-5) a species interaction can also point to a species (name) outside of the local dataset.\r\ntaxonID\r\n\r\nThe subject taxon the species interaction is about. Always required to point to an existing taxonID in the local dataset.\r\nrelatedTaxonID\r\n\r\nThe related taxon this interaction is describing. If given it must refer to a local taxonID from the dataset. If missing, the 'relatedTaxonScientificName' must be given instead.\r\nsourceID\r\n\r\nOptional identifier for the source this record came from as listed in the [metadata.yaml](https://github.com/CatalogueOfLife/coldp/blob/master/metadata.yaml)[](https://github.com/CatalogueOfLife/coldp/blob/master/README.md#relatedtaxonscientificname)[](https://github.com/CatalogueOfLife/coldp/blob/master/README.md#type-2)\r\nrelatedTaxonScientificName\r\n\r\nThe scientificName of the related taxon this interaction is describing. Includes the authorship if known. It is mutually exclusive with relatedTaxonID and if given no relatedTaxonID should exist. The relatedTaxonScientificName can be used to document species interactions without the need to have full blown name and taxon records.\r\ntype\r\n\r\ntype: [enum](http://api.catalogue.life/vocab/SpeciesInteractionType)\r\n\r\nThe kind of directed species interaction. Each interaction exists also in reverse to allow the alternative relatedTaxonScientificName field to be used.
