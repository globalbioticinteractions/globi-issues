For now, the neo4j server hosting GloBI indexes uses cypher v1.9 syntax by default. To make the version explicit, Cypher queries can be prefixed by \"CYPHER  1.9\". See https://github.com/jhpoelen/eol-globi-data/wiki/Cypher for examples.\r\n\r\nNote that this upgrade to neo4j v2.3.12 allows for supported upgrade paths to neo4j v3.x when needed. \r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/478637246/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
