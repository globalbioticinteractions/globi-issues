Also see https://doi.org/10.3897/tdwgproceedings.1.20298 and https://tdwgproceedings.pensoft.net/browse_user_collection_documents?collection_id=47. The idea is that having concrete example to work with might help facilitate conversations around capturing interaction data in a meaningful way.\r\n\r\nPerhaps José @zedomel or Antonio @saraiva-usp can help with pointing to a data archive with the pollinator interaction data.
