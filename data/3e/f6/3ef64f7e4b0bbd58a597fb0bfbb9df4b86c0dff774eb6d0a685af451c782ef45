Also reread your paper (briefly).  You nevertheless hint that some formats for ingestion are preferred over others (https://github.com/jhpoelen/eol-globi-data/issues/81).  Whether or not you want to influence things towards a standard _you_ do have perhaps one of the better feelings for what the data \"standard\" looks like that maximizes interoperability with Globi, and I'd argue, by prox, downstream \"real science\". Given this I'd ask the following, what is the data format that:\r\n\r\n* minimizes time required to integration in Globi\r\n* minimizes losiness during integration (for every one of those formats somethign is lost in translation)\r\n* gets used most by users of Globi that point to raw data(?) <- unfamiliar with whether this is a thing\r\n* gets the most downstream exposure by other wrappers (e.g. EOL)\r\n* ... etc.\r\n\r\nAll this to point out that we're at the point where we could envision discussing things like:\r\n* Dumping to the format you most prefer.  Our data model largely overlaps yours, with some differences in resolution (both more, and less in parts)\r\n* Figuring out a micro format/service by which users could ingest GLOBI data per their clade of interest for editing/integration/long term curation.  I'm not thinking of \"edit the whole dataset\", we're not really setup for that, I am thinking \"as I work towards a monograph of taxon X, then I want to gather everything known about them\".  I'm thinking along the lines of the story that we've enabled for importing references: \"user browses <somewhere> (globi), user finds <sha>, user adds that to input field in TW, ... <whirring>, ... PROFFIT!\".\r\n\r\nPerhaps we could guide this forward, slowly, with the use case along these lines: https://github.com/SpeciesFileGroup/taxonworks/issues/673\r\n\r\nPing to @reptalus.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/440311369/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/440355227","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/373#issuecomment-440355227","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/373","id":440355227,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MDM1NTIyNw==","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-20T17:17:06Z","updated_at":"2018-11-20T17:18:23Z","body":"@mjy I like your idea to establish a bi-directional link between GloBI and TaxonWorks, in which TaxonWorks uses to GloBI to lookup prior art as well as a way to make it easier biological associations data documented in monographs by openly sharing the data with GloBI.\r\n\r\nAs far as data formats / models go, I've been working towards writing up a more organized version of [Models in Fashion](https://www.globalbioticinteractions.org/2018/08/16/models-in-fashion/) to help better understand and dissect which formats/ models are suited in specific situations in [On Species Interaction Data Models and Formats](https://github.com/jhpoelen/globis-b-interactions/blob/master/text/on-species-interaction-data-models-and-formats.md).

We have made zero effort to optimize the API according to what you are looking for, everything, all at once, so your issues don't suprise me at all, and are well understood.\r\n\r\nPart of what we need from you is what you expect to see.  We can make dirt simple API calls that will give you the exact CSV tables 1:1, this will take probaly 30 seconds to get everything.  If you then want to piece together the realtionships and get the values out on your side, you'd be set.  If you want us to re-piece the data together as it's human read on our interfaces, then we're going to incur a lot of latency to index the dump you'd need, however sending the indexed result will be super fast.  An exmple of us doing that is the cached map API coming, where we take 10s-100s of thousands of reconds and summarize them as a single map.\r\n\r\nSo, 2 things 1, if you want the tables as raw CSV, all zipped up, open an issue on our tracker.  If you want an indexed version of the data in some format, then describe that format.\r\n\r\nFinally, I would point out that those in the broader community pushing for a graph/RDF world where data are modelled like in TaxonWorks would face many of these identical class of problems, but since they haven't actually built tools like TaxonWorks that seek to model Things, perhaps we haven't seen this type of problem being solved in the wild.

For some visual evidence of GloBI's newly added TaxonWorks associated association claims see below.\r\n\r\nTo summarize the current approach:\r\n\r\n1. Using a specialized [Preston](https://github.com/bio-guoda/preston) feature made available in [Preston v0.7.4](https://github.com/bio-guoda/preston/releases/tag/0.7.4), TaxonWorks biotic association claims were tracked, packaged, and transformed into format that allows for _stream_ processing the records \r\n2. These versioned, packaged and transformed TaxonWorks data resources were then made (openly) available via Zenodo [1] .\r\n3. A [TaxonWorks GloBI index configuration](https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/taxonworks) was created to aid discovery of these data via GloBI tools like [elton](https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/elton) and [nomer](https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/nomer).\r\n\r\nwith approach 1-3, manual work is needed to extract, version, package and publish TaxonWorks biotic associations such that they are able to be indexed by GloBI. This work involves making millions of Web API calls to the TaxonWorks Web API, dedicated hardware, and specialized data tracking/publication tools/knowledge. And, this is only a first pass at tapping into the vast amount of knowledge that the TaxonWorks platform keeps.\r\n\r\n# References \r\n\r\n[1] Poelen, Jorrit H. (2023).

After versioning and packaging the data, the same data was accessible in 7m22s, amounting to a couple of magnitude increase in access speeds (7 mins vs 14 hours).
