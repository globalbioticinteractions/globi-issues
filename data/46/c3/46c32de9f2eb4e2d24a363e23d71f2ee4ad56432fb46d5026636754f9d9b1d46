I know this is due to a limit in the number of rows for the download file, but it's very confusing for the user.  We need to provide a lot more help in navigating the constraints of this interface.  Here are a couple of suggestions:\n1. Explain why there may be more interactions in the download file.  \n   1.1. In the interactions table use \"unique interactions\" instead of just \"interactions\" when reporting the interactions count. \n   1.2. Where you provide the download links, add the following text:\n   Download interactions data: csv json dot\n   The file may include multiple records for each unique interaction.\n2. Don't give them truncated download files.\n   If the number of interactions exceeds what can be accommodated in the download file, ask the user to add constraints to their query.  Where you would show the download link, show a warning like this instead:  \"Too many interactions to fit into a download file.  To enable data download, please try a more specific search.\" \n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/169/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/169/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
