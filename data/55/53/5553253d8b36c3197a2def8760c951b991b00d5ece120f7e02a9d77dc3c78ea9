Confusingly, method 1) actually returns more results than method 2). \r\n\r\nMethod 1) returns 6 rows. It gets interactions between _M. bipustulatus_ and _Ranunculus_, _Ranunculus repens_, and _Ranunculus acris_:\r\n```\r\ntwoTaxa <- get_interactions_by_taxa(sourcetaxon = \"Ranunculus\", targettaxon = \"Malachius bipustulatus\",\r\n                         bbox=c(-180, 0, 180, 90 ))\r\nnrow(twoTaxa) \r\n```\r\nMethod 2) returns only 1 row. The interaction is between _M. bipustulatus_ and _Ranunculus repens_:\r\n```\r\noneTaxa <- get_interactions_by_taxa(sourcetaxon = \"Ranunculus\", \r\n                         bbox=c(-180, 0, 180, 90 ))\r\noneTaxa <- oneTaxa[oneTaxa$target_taxon_name == \"Malachius bipustulatus\",]\r\nnrow(oneTaxa)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhy doesn't method 2), which superficially seems like the 'wider query', grab the same rows that are in method 1)? Why doesn't method 2) also capture the links between _M. bipustulatus_ and _Ranunculus_/_Ranunculus acris_?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"H-Waters","id":45857086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1ODU3MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45857086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/H-Waters","html_url":"https://github.com/H-Waters","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/H-Waters/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/H-Waters/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/H-Waters/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/H-Waters/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/H-Waters/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/H-Waters/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/H-Waters/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/H-Waters/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/H-Waters/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/799/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/799/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
