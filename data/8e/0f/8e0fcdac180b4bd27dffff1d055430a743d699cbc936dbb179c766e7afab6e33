If you provide a specific example, I can help provide a specific example.\n\nBelow you'll find a snippet that create parent-child exclusion categories:\n\n``` R\n# OtherCat\n#\n# Creates a regex expression that helps to identify taxa with a parent that is not part of the provided child taxa list\n#\n# Example:\n# >expr <- OtherCat('Mollusca', c('Bivalvia','Gastropoda'))\n# >grep(expr, 'Mollusca | somethingelsa', perl=TRUE) == 1\n# TRUE\n# >grep(expr, 'Mollusca | Bivalvia', perl=TRUE) == 1\n# FALSE\n#\nOtherCat <- function(parent.taxon.name, excluded.child.taxon.names) {\nexcl.terms <- paste('(', excluded.child.taxon.names, ')', sep='', collapse='|')\npaste('(',parent.taxon.name,') \\\\| (?!',excl.terms,')', sep='')\n}\n```\n\nHope this helps.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/48949439/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
