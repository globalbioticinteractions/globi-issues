Yet, the nesting biology of most species remains poorly understood. Understanding soil preferences of bees is crucial to conservation efforts, as soil properties strongly influence nesting success, and to promote pollination services. -\n>\n>This project aims to compile and synthesize georeferenced observations of ground-nesting bees across Europe by combining citizen-science observations with soil and land-use data. By linking pollinator observations to soil conditions and other relevant ecological factors, the project seeks to expand our knowledge of habitat requirements and improve our understanding of pollinator–soil interactions. Conducted under the EU Horizon ProPollSoil initiative, contributions will directly support the conservation of soil-dependent pollinators across Europe.\n>\n>The project covers the following countries: Albania, Andorra, Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czechia (Czech Republic), Denmark, England, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Kosovo, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Moldova, Monaco, Montenegro, Netherlands, North Macedonia, Northern Ireland, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, San Marino, Scotland, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Ukraine, and Wales.\n> We focus on the following bee families: Andrenidae (including Andrena, Camptopoeum, Melitturga, Panurginus, and Panurgus), Apidae (including Amegilla, Ammobates, Ammobatoides, Ancyla, Anthophora, Apis, Biastes, Bombus, Ceratina, Epeoloides, Epeolus, Eucera, Habropoda, Melecta, Nomada, Parammobatodes, Pasites, Schmiedeknechtia, Tarsalia, Tetralonia, Thyreus, Triepeolus, and Xylocopa), Colletidae (including Colletes and Hylaeus), Halictidae (including Ceylalictus, Dufourea, Halictus, Lasioglossum, Nomioides, Pseudapis, Rophites, Sphecodes, Systropha, and Thrincohalictus), Megachilidae (including Afranthidium, Aglaoapis, Anthidiellum, Anthidium, Chelostoma, Coelioxys, Dioxys, Ensliniana, Eoanthidium, Haetosmia, Heriades, Hofferia, Hoplitis, Icteranthidium, Lithurgus, Megachile, Metadioxys, Osmia, Paradioxys, Protosmia, Pseudoanthidium, Rhodanthidium, Stelis, Stenoheriades, and Trachusa), and Melittidae (including Dasypoda, Macropis, and Melitta).\n>\n> Notice: Funded by the European Union.
