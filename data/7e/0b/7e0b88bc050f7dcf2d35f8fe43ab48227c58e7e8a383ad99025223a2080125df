Supporting references can either be explicit or inferred. For explicit evidence, the reference contains the exact (or close to) species interaction claim (e.g., bees pollinate plants).  For inferred evidence, the reference only supports the claim after following some domain logic. For example:  reference with url https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/6142809 contains a claim that *Apis melifera* pollinates *Ajuga reptans* . Because *Apis melifera* is a bee (Apis) and *Ajuga reptans* is a plant (Plantae), reference A supports, by inference, the claim that bees pollinate plants.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the basic web search tool at https://globalbioticinteractions.org lists only references that provide explicit support for claims matching the provided search criteria. \r\n\r\n@campmlc suggested to allow the user of the web interface to choose to include explicit and/or inferred references to supporting evidence.
