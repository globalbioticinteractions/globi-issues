In the indexed_interactions.* (example file attached), all initially submitted information except habitat is present. I would have expected this info to be in the review report, just to avoid any confusion like if this loss of info also reflects in the final GloBI datasets.\r\n[indexed-interactions.csv](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16564372/indexed-interactions.csv)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/1004/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/1004/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
