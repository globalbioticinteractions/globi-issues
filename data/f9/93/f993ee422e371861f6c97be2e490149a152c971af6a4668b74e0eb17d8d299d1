You mention that you accessed the \"stable\" version of interactions.tsv.gz on 14 June 2023. According to my records, this means that you used data from: \r\n> GloBI Community. (2022). Global Biotic Interactions: Interpreted Data Products (0.5) [Data set]. Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7348355 \r\nDid you consider including this data citation as part of your work and wiki pages? This data citation would help point more specifically to the data you used.\r\n\r\n2. You shared that you calculated \"two types of centrality indices: betweenness centrality and PageRank.\" Did you consider including a visualization or other data summary to help the reader understand the indices? \r\n\r\n3. In calculating the indices, you are likely enriching / improving the species interaction data indexed by GloBI. How do you imagine others re-using your indices?\r\n\r\nThank you for your efforts to document your usage of GloBI indexed datasets, and I am looking forward to hearing your thoughts on my three question above.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/1759615308/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/1776072130","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/928#issuecomment-1776072130","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/928","id":1776072130,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACXQt85p3LXC","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-23T21:45:53Z","updated_at":"2023-10-23T21:45:53Z","body":"@Ariakei thank you for sharing your update.
