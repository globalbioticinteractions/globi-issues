A reasonable target for the structure into which to map can be found [here](https://github.com/gbif/model-material/blob/master/schema.sql).

One of the things we'll try to figure out at the same time is if there is an obvious publishing model that is simpler than the Unified Model and can still support sharing biotic interactions data without loss.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/870/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/870/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
