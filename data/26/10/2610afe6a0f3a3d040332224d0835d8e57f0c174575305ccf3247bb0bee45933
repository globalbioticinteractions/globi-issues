Yes the example \"Paramoeba sp.\" would be an example, along with \"unclassified prokaryote\", or a name like \"Heterometopus sp. strain CSS\" (https://www.globalbioticinteractions.org/?accordingTo=globi%3Akbseah%2Fppsdb-globi-export&interactionType=ecologicallyRelatedTo&sourceTaxon=Heterometopus%20sp.%20strain%20CSS).\r\n\r\nMy consideration with the Open Nomenclature signs was that it would help flag cases where the identification to the species level was not certain and so the name mapping should not be used to retrieve sequence records. For example, if Paramoeba sp. were mapped to the NCBI taxon ID for the genus Paramoeba, this would lead to incorrect sequences being retrieved, if someone were to use the NCBI taxon ID mapping to find sequences.

Comments? \r\n\r\n> it attempts to match the supported databases by names, but can override this if a taxon ID is given?\r\n\r\nYes, it does attempt to match supported databases by name, with an override by id if given and supported by Nomer. \r\n\r\nThe idea of the workflow is that first, the id/name pairs are matched as is, then, if no match is found, the name is processed using the \"gbif-parse\" and \"globi-correct\" matchers. The gbif-parse matcher attempts to split a name string into their taxonomic parts (e.g., Homo sapiens L. -> Homo | Homo sapiens (taxonomic name parts) , genus | species (taxonomic rank), L. (authorship)) . \r\n\r\nThe `globi-correct` matcher does a bunch of different things, including removing unlikely taxonomic names (see https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globi-taxon-names/blob/main/non-taxon-words.txt) and mapping commonly used phrases (e.g., \"plants\") to their taxonomic counterpart (e.g., \"Plantae\") as defined in https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globi-taxon-names/blob/main/taxon-name-mapping.csv . \r\n\r\nAnyways, all this grew out of a desire to integrate disparate datasets to search across them.
