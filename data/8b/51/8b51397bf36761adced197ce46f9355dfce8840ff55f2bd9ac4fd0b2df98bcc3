Each agro-ecosystem has at least one main culture.\r\nI am using rglobi.\r\nI would like to create a matrix that selects parasitoids that interact, to one degree or more, with the main culture.\r\nTo do this I would have to use cypher, I guess, and not just get_interaction_matrix (which I can't get to work anyway in rglobi)\r\nBut I can't even make a list of the insects that interact directly with the main culture, for example grapes.\r\nI tried like this:\r\n`query(\"START sourceTaxon = node:taxons(name='Vitis') MATCH sourceTaxon<-[:CLASSIFIED_AS]-source-[:interactsWith]->target-[:CLASSIFIED_AS]->targetTaxon RETURN targetTaxon\")`\r\n\r\nIn the example in https://neo4j.globalbioticinteractions.org/webadmin/#/data/search/START%20predatorTaxon%20%3D%20node%3Ataxons%28name%3D%27Thunnus%20thynnus%27%29%0AMATCH%20predatorTaxon%3C-[%3ACLASSIFIED_AS]-predator-[%3AATE]-%3Eprey-[%3ACLASSIFIED_AS]-%3EpreyTaxon%3C-[%3ACLASSIFIED_AS]-pred2-[%3AATE]-%3Eprey2-[%3ACLASSIFIED_AS]-%3EpreyOfPreyTaxon%0ARETURN%20predatorTaxon.name%20as%20predatorName%2C%20preyTaxon.name%20as%20preyName%2C%20count%28distinct%20preyOfPreyTaxon.name%29%20as%20preyOfPreyCount/ what means [:ATE]? The list of InteractionTypes doesn't contain this.\r\n\r\nMany many thanks, because cypher seems like a good idea to me, it just has to be learned, and it doesn't seem as easy as it seems on first reading.\r\n\r\nP.S.: I read this https://www.globalbioticinteractions.org/2020/08/25/extracting-parasite-interaction-data/\r\nwell that's what I'm trying to do.\r\nAmong other things, the entomologist I work with has just published the second volume of his research, and there are also interactions in tables that could be exported: https://www.google.it/books/edition/I_calcidoidei_d_Italia_e_regioni_adiacen/aS2GzgEACAAJ?hl=en Adriano, the entomologist, is not a professor or university researcher, his passion for taxonomy is thirty years old, and he has researched chalcidoidei throughout Italy","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/686/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/686/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
