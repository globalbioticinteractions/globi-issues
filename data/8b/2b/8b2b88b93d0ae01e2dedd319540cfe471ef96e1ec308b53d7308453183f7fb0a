When I query the graph they do not exist. If I understand the situation, that raises another question, to wit, why the most recent harvest didn't provide any new records for this source taxon and predicate, since previous harvests clearly did and they are still present at GloBI. I wonder if the presence of ghost records interferes with publication of similar records in a new harvest. \r\n\r\n@jhpoelen if my guess is right, there's nothing you can do, but thank you for reporting. We're working on this Failure To Delete issue and are pretty sure it's native to EOL. It may be that only GloBI is affected, but that could be because those records are a different shape from our other data.","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/1997987265/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/1998036694","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/970#issuecomment-1998036694","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/970","id":1998036694,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACXQt853F57W","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-14T18:03:07Z","updated_at":"2024-03-14T18:03:07Z","body":"@jhammock thanks for your prompt reply.
