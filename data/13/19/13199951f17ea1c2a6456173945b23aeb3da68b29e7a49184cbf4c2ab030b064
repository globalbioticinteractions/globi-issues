The domains of micro- and macro-biodiversity data have separate, mature data repositories with robust and commonly used data standards. However, when a researcher has to link those domains to better understand disease dynamics, there is a paucity of unifying frameworks. The Wildlife Disease Data Standard (WDDS) brings those mature systems together in a user friendly and extensible format. Designed by a diverse set of members of the Verena Institute, the data attributes in WDDS draw on the mature data standards from each domain (e.g. Genbank, Darwin Core) to place equal emphasis on micro- and macro-biodiversity data attributes, as well as reporting of both presence and absence of a host-pathogen relationship. This combination facilitates the creation of FAIR data sets with high utility for practitioners across the One Health spectrum.\n\n\n<img width=\"1106\" height=\"640\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dbe45aaf-1c37-4e82-9e97-11b6fe94a2fb\" />","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/1108/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/1108/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
