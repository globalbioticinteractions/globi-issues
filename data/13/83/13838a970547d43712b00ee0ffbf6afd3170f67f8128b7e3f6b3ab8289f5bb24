We did update the Dynamic Hierarchy recently, and that may have retrieved some of the old mappings to v2. I know some effort was made in that direction.

We expect non-DH pages to look like [this](https://eol.org/pages/52499829) - to have an \"Unresolved name\" warning at the top and not show the breadcrumb immediately. This one may have slipped through because it was recognized by the previous version of the DH. We'll investigate.
