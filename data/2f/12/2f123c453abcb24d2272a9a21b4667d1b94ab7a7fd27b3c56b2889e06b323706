You can find an archive [here](https://globi.s3.amazonaws.com/snapshot/target/eol-globi-datasets-1.0-SNAPSHOT-darwin-core-aggregated-roll-up.zip).\n\nWith the current implementation, all permutations between taxonomic ranks up to `order` are used to infer interactions. For instance, if an interaction between specimen with (sub)species level classification are recorded, this will amount about 4 \\* 5 = 20 interactions. For example, man (_Homo sapiens_) eating dog (_Canis lupus familiaris_), will expand to:\n\n| source | type | target |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| _Homo sapiens_ | ate | _Canis lupus familiaris_ |\n| Homo | ate | _Canis lupus famliaris_ |\n| Hominidae | ate | _Canis lupus familiaris_ |\n| Primates | ate | _Canis lupus familiaris_ |\n| _Homo sapiens_ | ate | _Canis lupus_ |\n| _Homo sapiens_ | ate | Canis |\n| _Homo sapiens_ | ate | Canidae |\n| _Homo sapiens_ | ate | Carnivora |\n| ... | ... | ... |\n\nPlease confirm that this is the desired behavior.\n\nThe most recent archive with rolled-up taxa aggregated by study and interaction type, this amounts to about 2.3M associations (i.e. interactions) between about 81k taxa (of any rank). The (compressed) archive is about 50MB, while the uncompressed archive contains about 1.2GB (!). This is about 5x the currently used archive (w/ study interaction type aggregation).\n\nI noticed that the meta data format used does not pass the [GBIF archive validator](http://tools.gbif.org/dwca-validator/) . What is EOLs policy on darwin core archive validation?\n\nLooking forward to your feedback!\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/69790911/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/69802241","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/79#issuecomment-69802241","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/79","id":69802241,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5ODAyMjQx","user":{"login":"cmungall","id":50745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmungall","html_url":"https://github.com/cmungall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmungall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmungall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmungall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmungall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmungall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmungall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmungall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmungall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmungall/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-13T19:20:16Z","updated_at":"2015-01-13T19:20:57Z","body":"If space is an issue, then instead of `N* × M*`, what about `N* × M ∪ N × M*`? i.e. 4+5 rather than 4*5 tuples in this case.\n\ni.e. you wouldn't have `Primates ate Canidae`\n\nAdvantages: queries of the form \"what interacts with X\" (where X can be higher level taxa like primates or canids) could be directly supported using pre-inferred assertions.\n\nDisadvantages: queries of the form \"does X interact with Y\" cannot be directly calculated without taxonomic inference. \n\nEither way, presumably after the query is performed you only want to report the most specific.

As far as I am concerned size is not an issue: the compressed archives are pretty manageable.
