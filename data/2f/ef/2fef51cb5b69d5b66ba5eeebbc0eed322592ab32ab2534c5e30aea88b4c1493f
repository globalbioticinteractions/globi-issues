However, I'm not sure If I did the integration steps correctly. \r\n\r\nFor step 1, I tried to fork again the template dataset but I kept being sent to my [previous forked dataset](https://github.com/fgabriel1891/Plant-Frugivore-Interactions-SouthEastAsia). So I ended up cloning the template repository and commit/edit the new information. I linked the new GitHub repository already with Travis and Zenodo.  \r\n\r\nIs it ok doing it this way?  Is the interaction information linked to GloBi? \r\n\r\nThanks!!\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"fgabriel1891","id":23193439,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTkzNDM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23193439?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fgabriel1891","html_url":"https://github.com/fgabriel1891","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fgabriel1891/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fgabriel1891/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fgabriel1891/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fgabriel1891/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fgabriel1891/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fgabriel1891/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fgabriel1891/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fgabriel1891/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fgabriel1891/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/336/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/336/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
