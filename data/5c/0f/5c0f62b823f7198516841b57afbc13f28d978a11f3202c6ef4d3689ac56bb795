Now that the dataset is growing, the performance of the queries are starting to be a little suboptimal.\n\nBy introducing a spatial index, the performance is expected to increase.\n\nNeo4j has a spatial plugin (http://github.com/neo4j/spatial) that might be worth looking into. However, I am open to suggestions on how to move forward on this. Perhaps a hybrid solution is in place or even switching databases all together (oh my!). \n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/139/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/139/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
