For example, “Ixodes ricinus” is listed as a valid taxon in some data sources and an invalid one in others. If I was searching for data belonging to what I consider to be the valid synonym of “Ixodes ricinus” (=Ixodes aragaoi), I won’t get the interaction data of “Ixodes ricinus” if I look for “Ixodes aragaoi”.
