I put this dataset in EOL's DwC-A excel template. Three things to note:\n\na new (stand-in) association term, already in EOL system: http://eol.org/schema/terms/IsDispersalVectorFor\n(there's a vector term in RO but judging by the definition source, it is meant only for pathogens)\n\nThere are some child measurements of the association records, for metadata, in the measurementOrFact tab. Is that alright? (Eats what body part? Disperses what propagule?)\n\nThere are also some independent non-associations traits in the measurementOrFact tab- properties of the seeds and fruit. I think GloBI has incidentally included traits like this before in resources, and sent them to EOL in the DwC-A export. Is it convenient to leave them in and handle them that way? If not I can take them out and load them to EOL separately.\n\nThanks!\n\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/33761226/animal%20seed%20size.xlsx\n","closed_by":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/160/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/160/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
