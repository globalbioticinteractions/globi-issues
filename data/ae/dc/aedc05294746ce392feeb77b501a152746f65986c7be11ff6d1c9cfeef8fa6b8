Is this an omen? And, custom interaction type mappings can be defined to help support your suggested \"forage on\" -> \"visits flower of\" interpretation. If you feel forage \r\nAnd, GloBI does not index all of GBIF, although José Augusto Salim already has successfully done experiments in combining preston with elton (see https://github.com/zedomel/globi-dwca-index) to index interactions all of iDigBio/GBIF/BioCASe. \r\nCurrently, specific RSS feeds or individual dwca endpoints are configured for GloBI indexing. E.g., https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/scan and https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/msb-para .\r\nAlso, note that the GloBI dropdown does not include all supported terms. Perhaps better is to use http://www.ontobee.org/search?ontology=RO&keywords=visits&submit=Search+terms . And, finally, if you feel a new term should be added to the Relation Ontology, your can propose new terms (see e.g., https://github.com/oborel/obo-relations/issues/419) directly. Happy to help if you or your collaborators get stuck. \r\nHope this helps, and let me know how you intend to use the bee-pollinator data to help inform how to best leverage GloBI indexing/review capabilities. \r\nthx,\r\n-jorrit\r\n\r\nJorrit,\r\n\r\nThis all looks good and I will look this over tomorrow or Friday.  It is helpful to see how the pieces fit.  Right now I do not have a clue how to leverage GLoBI, but I am confident that one or more options will surface over the coming weeks.
