Species is always best, because even in the case of genera with multiple species there can be notable differences in prey and predators among the species. It's a very good question though, because in other cases, there is a lot of uniformity within genera. Very few people have investigated this. I noticed in the coral reef data that congeneric species rarely had exactly the same links. But reef species are notorious for behavioural and habitat specialization. It could be very different in other habitats. Would be interesting to check with other big datasets.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/34217924/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/34231910","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/47#issuecomment-34231910","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/47","id":34231910,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0MjMxOTEw","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-02-05T20:07:41Z","updated_at":"2014-02-05T20:07:41Z","body":"Thanks for your comment!

The feature described in this issue would provide a way to exclude higher order taxa by means of expressing something like: I'd only like to include prey/predator that were classified on genus or species taxon tanks. So, to me is sounds like this feature would support your desire to only select specific taxonomic ranks. \n\nI hope this makes sense.
