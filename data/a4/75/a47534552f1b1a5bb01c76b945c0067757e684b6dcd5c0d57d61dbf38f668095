As a result of a recent strategic planning effort, we are no longer working on coastal/marine classification development or data curation and can no longer invest in maintaining the site.\r\n\r\nNOAA is working on a new catalog, but there will be a lag between the time our site goes down and they implement theirs.   In the interim, please visit the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information's CMECS website (https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/coastal-marine-ecological-classification-standard) for information about the CMECS vocabulary and maintenance.\r\n\r\nI have copied Kate Rose from NOAA.  She might also be able to help with any questions you might have.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nKathy Goodin\r\n```","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/752/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/752/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
