Some of the issues are based around life history stage e.g. Catfish eggs. While correcting these I have changed the corrected term (Siluriformes) but we should also include the life history stage. Saying something eats catfish eggs is very different fro saying it eats catfish! I started filling in the life history stage field in this .csv but am not sure whether this is the correct place to do it. Let me know if you want to me to continue or add the information in elsewhere. Alternatively, it may be easier for you just to write a little code which would add a terms ‘eggs’ or ‘larvae’ to the life history stage field if either appeared in the original field. Either way, it would be a neat addition to globi as users could then search for egg eaters etc rather than trying to figure it out themselves.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/76/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/76/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
