For instance, pandas might interpret quotes, commas or other non-tab characters as separators or escape characters. For some reason, many well-used program did not respect the IANA tsv definition (see https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/text/tab-separated-values and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tab-separated_values) .\r\n\r\nA prominent example of incorrectly parsing of tsv files is https://github.com/tidyverse/readr/issues/844 , in which tsv files are not read using the IANA tsv specification by default, but instead treat quotes as special characters. \r\n\r\nDue to previous instances of these kinds of tsv parsing issues, interactions.csv.gz was also made available. For some reason, the more complicated csv format (e.g., escaping comma's) causes fewer parsing issues in commonly used libraries.\r\n\r\nHope this helps and curious to hear your thoughts.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/766923470/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/766932191","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/594#issuecomment-766932191","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/594","id":766932191,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2NjkzMjE5MQ==","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-25T16:19:34Z","updated_at":"2021-01-25T16:21:02Z","body":"Just for completeness,  here's the reportedly offending line 3626856 including lines 3626855 and 3626857.

Hurray!\r\n\r\nIf you have a moment, I'd be great if you could share a code snippet that succeeded reading the csv file and the code snippet that failed to read the tsv file. This way I hope to make sure that we pinpoint the issue to a suspected misconfigured tsv parser.

Your tsv reading example confirm my suspicions in that tab-separated-files are often mistaken for comma-separated-file with a tab (i.e. ```\\t```) as a separator. However, tsv files, according to IANA definition, do not have the complicated and confusing quoting and escaping that come with the csv files. \r\n\r\nIn this case, the csv reader got confused by reading a tsv files because some character was misinterpreted as an unescaped control character. \r\n\r\nSo, pandas is trying to be too smart and that causes problems. You can probably read valid tsv files by making sure that all the quoting etc. is disabled or by using a simple line-by-line string splitter. But hey, csv works, so it sounds like you a good to go!\r\n\r\nIn short - interactions.tsv.gz is valid IANA tsv , so I am closing this issue.  \r\n\r\nThanks for your patience!","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/769316938/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
