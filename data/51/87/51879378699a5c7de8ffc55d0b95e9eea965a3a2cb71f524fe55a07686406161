This is\nlocated at http://MYDOMAIN/dwca.zip, thus for the louse Scratchpad\nsite this would be http://phthiraptera.info/dwca.zip. That said, this\nis not turned on the Phthiraptera.org, and also we are re-writing the\nwas we write these archives to make it more sustainable. From November\nyou will find 3 dwca files at the root URL of a site (dwca-eol.zip,\ndwca-gbif.zip and dwca-taxonomy.zip). These will validate against\nEOL's and GBIF's slightly different flavours of dwca, while the\ntaxonomy one is simply the main taxonomy used within a site.

Vince indicated to me he wanted to talk a little more about it first, so it'll have to wait until he's had time for that chat, but I'm confident we'll publish the classification eventually and there's a good chance it'll be soon... [...]\n```\n\nSo, rather than integrating the phthiraptera archive directly into GloBI, we can leverage EOL's API to resolve taxa described by phthiraptera.info . . .
