The GloBI Browse tool exists to assist quick discovery of indexed interaction records. The download button on the discovery tool only returns up to 4096 records. If you intend to do research with the data, I would recommend using a copy of the full index via the gzipped tab-separated-values file at https://depot.globalbioticinteractions.org/snapshot/target/data/tsv/interactions.tsv.gz and select rows with pollinator related interactions (e.g., \"pollinates\", \"pollinatedBy\", \"visitsFlowersOf\", \"flowersVisitedBy\", \"visits\", \"visitedBy\") using some script or computer program that you are familiar with. \r\n\r\nFor instance, using a linux command-line, a crude sub-selection of pollinator data can be made by:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl -L https://depot.globalbioticinteractions.org/snapshot/target/data/tsv/interactions.tsv.gz > interactions.tsv.gz \r\nzcat interactions.tsv.gz | grep -P \"(pollinates)|(pollinatedBy)|(visitsFlowersOf)|(flowersVisitedBy)|(visits)|(visitedBy)\r\n```\r\nSimilar operations can be done using [R](https://r-project.org) in combination with tidyverse or other R packages . \r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have more questions.\r\n\r\nRelated to #454 .
