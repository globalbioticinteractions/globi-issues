Bummer that you got an error page. \r\n\r\nThe reason why you are unable to connect to the neo4j interface is because it is no longer publicly available. Allowing to run open-ended queries (e.g., Cypher queries) on a public neo4j causes the main GloBI website and API to be at the mercy of whoever happens to run a query.  Also, having folks write queries that run against specific versions of neo4j and/or GloBI schema would provide less room for doing software maintenance (e.g., upgrade neo4j, optimize GloBI schema). \r\n\r\nIn other words, the neo4j instance that GloBI website / API is using is up and running, but no longer publicly accessible to run queries on it directly. This is also why rglobi > 0.3.x doesn't support running Cypher queries directly anymore (see https://github.com/ropensci/rglobi/releases/tag/v0.3.4) .\r\n\r\nHowever, you run your own instance by downloading a neo4j db archive from https://globalbioticinteractions.org/data and run it with a supported neo4j version (currently an \"ancient\" version v3.5.x, but see also  #860 ).\r\n\r\nApologies for the inconvenience, and I hope you understand that GloBI is trying to balance providing easier access to millions of openly available species interaction claims with keeping the overhead/cost of running servers / maintenance down.\r\n\r\nAlso, please do share any ideas you may have to make it easier to access openly available species interaction data records.\r\n\r\n-jorrit\r\n\r\nPS I'll make a separate issue for removing any reference to neo4j access in the documentation.
