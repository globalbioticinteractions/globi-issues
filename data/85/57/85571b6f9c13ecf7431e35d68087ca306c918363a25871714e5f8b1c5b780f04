This would save us a bunch of time and would simplify the taxon name corrections file. A list similar to taxonNameCorrections would be published, but then only containing the life stage terms. \n\nI imagine the mapping file to look something like:\n\n| provided | corrected | id | notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| eggs | egg | http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0007379 | I really like notes |\n| larvae | larva | http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0002548 | more notes |\n\n...\n\nThis way, contributors can easily add or correct terms using github web editors and the term mapping can be automated.  With this, taxon identification strings would be scanned for life history terms and populated in the life stage field using a standardized term.\n\n@BrianHayden Does this sounds like a good plan? If not, do you have any other suggestions?\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/45926709/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/45927072","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/76#issuecomment-45927072","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/76","id":45927072,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1OTI3MDcy","user":{"login":"jhammock","id":3026567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMjY1Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3026567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhammock","html_url":"https://github.com/jhammock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhammock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhammock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhammock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhammock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhammock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhammock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhammock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhammock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhammock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-06-12T18:07:11Z","updated_at":"2014-06-12T18:07:11Z","body":"We have URIs for a few such things if you're interested.

This duplication annoys some people but it's useful for some purposes. In general you're better to use the stage term, but ultimately it probably doesn't matter much as the mapping can be done automatically. And it looks like we don't have 'egg stage' in Uberon...\n\nOnce you get into highly species-specific staging (e.g. carnegie stage 10a in humans)  then we typically farm out the staging ontology to a domain-specific group.
