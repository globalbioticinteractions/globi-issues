Unfortunately, I was unable to read the article, because it is not open access. However, in reading the abstract and associated information, it looks like the authors used ICES and CEFAS stomach datasets, both of which are indexed by GloBI. However, more information is needed to better understand their dataset. Would you happen to have a link to their dataset or some pre-print copy of the article?","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/647623023/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/648095103","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/514#issuecomment-648095103","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/514","id":648095103,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0ODA5NTEwMw==","user":{"login":"dswdejonge","id":46383604,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MzgzNjA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46383604?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dswdejonge","html_url":"https://github.com/dswdejonge","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dswdejonge/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dswdejonge/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dswdejonge/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dswdejonge/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dswdejonge/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dswdejonge/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dswdejonge/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dswdejonge/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dswdejonge/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-23T11:48:14Z","updated_at":"2020-06-23T11:48:14Z","body":"@jhpoelen I managed to find a pre-print.

Here, we compile a new marine dataset containing 8092 unique predator‐prey interactions from 415,294 fish stomachs. We demonstrate how feeding guilds (i.e. groupings based on diet and life stage) could be defined systematically and in a way that is conducive to their application internationally across ecosystems; and apply them to the North Sea fish assemblage to demonstrate their responsiveness to anthropogenic pressures.\r\n\r\n, I wonder what their results would produce for other GloBI-indexed stomach datasets like GoMexSI, NOAA REEM and the Southern Ocean Dietary Database:\r\n\r\nhttps://gomexsi.tamucc.edu \r\n\r\nResource Ecology and Ecosystem Modeling (REEM) - Groundfish Diet Data of Aleutian Islands, Alaska Fisheries Science Center, NOAA; Resource Ecology and Ecosystem Modeling (REEM) - Groundfish Diet Data of Gulf of Alaska, Alaska Fisheries Science Center, NOAA; Resource Ecology and Ecosystem Modeling (REEM) - Groundfish Diet of Data Bering Sea, Alaska Fisheries Science Center, NOAA \r\n\r\nRaymond, B., Marshall, M., Nevitt, G., Gillies, C., van den Hoff, J., Stark, J.S., Losekoot, M., Woehler, E.J., and Constable, A.J.
