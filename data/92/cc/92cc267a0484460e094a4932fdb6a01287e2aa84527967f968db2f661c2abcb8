Do I have still to go thru species nomenclature mapping, or I am good if I just use latin name \"Ursus arctos\" and get all the aggregated data at this point?\r\n\r\nThe nanopubs is using the names as provided by the data source. So, this does *not* include name alignment, at least not yet . . . So, if a data source provides some kind of taxon id (e.g., NCBI:9606 for _Homo sapiens_), the nanopubs may include it, otherwise, only the provided names are included.\r\n\r\nNote that, if you'd like, you can use some other tool like [Nomer](https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/nomer), an associated tool https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/name-alignment-template, or your own methods to add the linkages. \r\n\r\nAlso note that the \"Browse\" results are generated after GloBI's name alignment process, so the results may vary a little, depending on the effect of name alignment processes.
