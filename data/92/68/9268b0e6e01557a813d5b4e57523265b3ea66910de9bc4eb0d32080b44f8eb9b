The intent is to use this extension to record biotic interactions. The approach is similar to a past discussion https://github.com/trias-project/uredinales-belgium-checklist/issues/8 with @peterdesmet @qgroom @LienReyserhove and @baskaufs . \r\n\r\nNote that resolving https://github.com/tdwg/dwc/issues/186 is expected to help to make the recorded relationship easier to read for machines. Until identifiers for resource relationship types are supported,  the free text field [relationshipOfResource](http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/#relationshipOfResource) will be used to derive the type of recorded interaction.\r\n\r\n[dwca-fmnh-rr-test-v1.1.zip](https://github.com/jhpoelen/eol-globi-data/files/3586074/dwca-fmnh-rr-test-v1.1.zip)","closed_by":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/406/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/406/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
