However, for publications, I favor the use of published datasets instead. This way, you can keep your own copy of the dataset you used, and perhaps even publish it along with your derived (data) products (e.g., intermediate data, tables, graphs). \r\n\r\nAPIs are a dynamic thing (sort of a doorgeefluik) and typically lack the ability to trace the provenance (or origin) of their data: APIs are running on servers (aka \"in the cloud\"), and the content and configuration of these servers are not easy to document and reproduce. So, re-creating the results of an API can be quite challenging. \r\n\r\nIn contrast, a published dataset can be more easily downloaded, copied, re-published, because their content are static. In other words, you can more easily point to a published datasets and verify their authenticity (is the dataset really the one that was cited), then it is to recreate some dynamic server and re-run a query. \r\n\r\nI'd be curious to learn more about your use case, and am confident more reliable methods can be applied to transform existing species interaction datasets into the kind of research dataset that you'd like to analyze.\r\n\r\nAs far as I understand your workflow is:\r\n\r\n1. create a checklist of taxonomic names of interest (checklist A)\r\n2. select interactions that relate to the checklist (primary interaction dataset)\r\n3. create a checklist of taxonomic names (checklist B) that are claimed to interact with organisms from checklist A.\r\n4. select interactions that related to checklist B (secondary interaction dataset) \r\n\r\nPlease let me know if I understand your workflow correctly. Once I understand your workflow, I may be able to suggest some workflows that do not rely on servers that may very well change in the future (or disappear altogether). \r\n\r\nHope this helps.\r\n\r\n-jorrit\r\n\r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/1346615167/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/1351700367","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/853#issuecomment-1351700367","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/853","id":1351700367,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACXQt85QkU-P","user":{"login":"jrhillae","id":35692395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NjkyMzk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35692395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrhillae","html_url":"https://github.com/jrhillae","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrhillae/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrhillae/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrhillae/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrhillae/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrhillae/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrhillae/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrhillae/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrhillae/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrhillae/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-14T16:08:40Z","updated_at":"2022-12-14T16:08:40Z","body":"@jhpoelen: Thank you for your reply.\r\n\r\nOur workflow is:\r\n\r\n1.

To be honest, I am a bit overwhelmed by the process of taxonomic alignment, nomer and creating a network. By nomer, we extend the search of species over all possible databases and obtain a very diverse range of original species names. But when I want to create the network I should again compile all this information into one node per species. Therefore, it should be handy for me to know which column has (generally) the same value per unique species in interactions.tsv.gz. I assume column 8 and 48 are good candidates for this purpose? They seem to be the accepted scientific name according to a certain taxonomic backbone?

thank you for your help. Is it correct that name_alignment is separate from nomer and not the same? Just to be sure I understand the difference between both.\r\n\r\nThe outcome is certainly an improvement. So I now should now run nomer again but based on the list of aligned names (the third column) within the output file? I checked the start of the document it but it does not yet seem perfect.
