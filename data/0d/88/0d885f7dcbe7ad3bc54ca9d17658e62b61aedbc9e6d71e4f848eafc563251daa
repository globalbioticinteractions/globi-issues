In some settings, GloBI indexes are used to do analysis. While users of a specific version of interactions.tsv.gz (one of those provided indexes) can publish the copy of the index themselves, a more centralized and open publication method can be considered. \r\n\r\nAn option would be to take weekly, monthly or yearly snapshots of GloBI indexes and publish them via Zenodo or other data publication platforms. \r\n\r\nNote that the *input* of GloBI is already being versioned/published via  http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3523403 (Elton cache) and http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3707006 (GloBI taxon graph) and releases of software used to create the indexes are already released an published.  The rationale for this is that you can recreate indexes, but you can't easily recreate source data and taxonomic hierarchies. \r\n\r\n@nleguillarme or others  please let me know if you have any ideas on how to improve how GloBI makes the species interaction data indexes available.","closed_by":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/475/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/475/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
