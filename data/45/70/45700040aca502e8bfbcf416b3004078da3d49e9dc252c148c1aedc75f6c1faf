Since tiger beetles (Carabidae: Cicindelinae) are sometimes considered as a separate family, to avoid taxonomic discrepancies, we also searched “Cicindelidae” and “Fungi”. For this query, we used the application programming interface (API) provided by GloBI. Since the GloBI dataset provided neither references for the interactions, nor the locations where the interactions were reported from, we ran a series of web searches targeting each registered interaction to find the original sources. We also mined academic databases and search platforms, including the Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Baidu Research with the keyword sets of “Carabidae AND Fungi” or “Carabid* AND Fung*”. Additional searches were conducted using the words for ground beetles and fungi in Arabic, Chinese, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Hungarian, Japanese, Norwegian, Polish, Russian, Spanish, and Swedish languages (Fig. 3).\r\n\r\nThere's a couple of dubious statements in this paragraph. \r\n\r\n1. authors claims that ```GloBI is a subsite of GBIF``` - as of yet, there's no formal collaboration or partnership agreement between GloBI and GBIF. However, the two projects do have some overlap in the datasets they index. Also GloBI currently re-uses a software library from GBIF to help process DwC-A files.\r\n\r\n2. authors claim that ```GloBI dataset provided neither references for the interactions, nor the locations where the interactions were reported from``` . Each and every interaction data records has associated citation for both the origin (data source) and the authority of the claim supported by the record. Also, from https://globalbioticinteractions.org/data:\r\n\r\n\r\n> \"Exploratory, interactive queries can be executed through SPARQL and Cypher (see more examples) endpoints, GloBI Search/Browse pages, or by using the REST-y GloBI Web API. For those that use R, rglobi is available to explore interaction data. rglobi can also be used to execute Cypher queries.\r\n\r\n> For research or other data intensive project, please use GloBI’s stable versioned integrated data published via doi:10.5281/zenodo.3950589 or, perhaps even better, consider using the original underlying datasets. Please see the process page to better understand how GloBI integrates data so that you can make an informed decision on what data to use for your studies.\"","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/963352290/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/963432169","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/724#issuecomment-963432169","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/724","id":963432169,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACXQt845bM7p","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-08T18:15:59Z","updated_at":"2021-11-08T18:15:59Z","body":"fyi @pozsgaig .
