Dryad Digital Repository. http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.nv5d2 Accessed at http://datadryad.org/bitstream/handle/10255/dryad.94536/CCPDDlinkdata_v1.csv` and this particular study. \n\nThe reason I am interested in this is that Szoboszlai et al. 2015 published the data in a way that is machine readable and allows for tracing the food web link assertions back to supporting evidence. I would imagine that the scientists whose work you used to construct your food web might appreciate a data reference to their publication. In addition, a researcher who is interested in carefully studying the food web link assertions that were made, would need this information to trace back to the supporting evidence. From the text in [your publication](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep21179) \"[...] A total of 20,145 feeding links were observed in the field or compiled from descriptions in 1,532 peer-reviewed publications, dissertations, technical reports, or online databases, a more comprehensive version of the sources used in Wood et al. 2015. [...]\", I would expect to see at many as 1,532 references associated to the food web links.\n\nPlease let me know what I can do to associate proper data citation with the food web you shared. Ideally, a previously used format like Szoboszlai et al. 2015 would be re-used to avoid extra work in making your valuable work machine readable.\n\n-jorrit\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/191331907/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/192373487","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/210#issuecomment-192373487","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/210","id":192373487,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5MjM3MzQ4Nw==","user":{"login":"woodsp","id":2513700,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MTM3MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2513700?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/woodsp","html_url":"https://github.com/woodsp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/woodsp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/woodsp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/woodsp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/woodsp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/woodsp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/woodsp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/woodsp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/woodsp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/woodsp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-04T17:34:27Z","updated_at":"2016-03-04T17:34:27Z","body":"Hi Jorrit, indeed, the webs were constructed using very similar methods as Szoboszlai et al 2015 and Wood et al 2015.

Out of the three formats you've used across Szoboszlai et al. 2015, Wood et al. 2015 and Dunne et al. 2016, I like the one from Wood et al. 2015 best: a structured, single-table format in csv that is easy to parse. \n\n![screen shot 2016-03-23 at 2 54 06 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1084872/14002466/70e2b466-f109-11e5-9085-33da6d7efbff.png)\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/200560934/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
