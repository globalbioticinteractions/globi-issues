Are you able to access it?\n\nHere's a reply from BHL:\n\n---\n\nfrom: feedback@biodiversitylibrary.org\nThu, 25 Jun 2015 11:45:52 -0700 (PDT)\n\nDear Jorrit Poelen,\n\nThank you for submitting your feedback to the Biodiversity Heritage Library concerning the digital scans of Seton, E.T. (1929) Lives of game animals [...]. Your observation that the digital files are missing is much appreciated. \n\nThese scans were created by an institution that is not affiliated with the BHL, and therefore we are not responsible for their content. The files were automatically ingested into the BHL portal from the Internet Archive (IA). Later, IA removed the images from their collection. Therefore, the images were no longer being served to BHL. \n\nNormally, we would ask a [BHL Partner Library](http://biodivlib.wikispaces.com/BHL+Consortium#BHLparticipatingInstitutions) to scan this title and replace this record.  However, unfortunately, the publication date for this work is beyond the copyright cut-off date. I have removed the title from the BHL, in accordance with our policies regarding copyright law. We are unable to offer works published in or after 1923 unless we obtain permission from the copyright holder. For more information, see [our guide](http://biodivlib.wikispaces.com/Licensing+and+Copyright). \n\nIf you have any information that might help us obtain permission to scan this work, please share it with us. We have been able to broker agreements with a number of copyright holders such that the BHL does hold some in-copyright materials.  \n\nFrom the link you sent us, I can see that there was a question about the holdings of the Smithsonian Libraries (SIL), one of our partners, and where the Secretariat and other staff (including myself) are based.  I can see that this title is held by SIL in the Mammals Library at the National Museum of Natural History under [bib 110484](http://siris-libraries.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=1CX52N7287332.4038&profile=liball&uri=full=3100001%7E%21110484%7E%211&aspect=Keyword&menu=search&source=%7E%21silibraries&view=subscriptionsummary&ri=3&staffonly=&term=Lives+of+Game+Animals&index=TW&uindex=&aspect=Keyword&menu=search&ri=3). You may also find the text at a number of BHL Partner Institutions and other libraries under [OCLC number 11464601](http://www.worldcat.org/title/lives-of-game-animals-an-account-of-those-land-animals-in-america-north-of-the-mexican-border-which-are-considered-game-either-because-they-have-held-the-attention-of-sportsmen-or-received-the-protection-of-law/oclc/11464601&referer=brief_results). I hope that you and your colleagues find this information of use.\n\nAgain, thank you for submitting your feedback to BHL. Users such as yourself help the BHL to improve, and we appreciate our users taking the time to inform us of errors. It is unfortunate that we could not be of more help to you in this instance. I hope that you will continue to find other materials that you require in the BHL and to offer us suggestions for the improvement of our digital collections.\n\nWith thanks,\n\nJacqueline E. Chapman\nDigital Collections Librarian\n\n---\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/115367787/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/115374648","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/142#issuecomment-115374648","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/142","id":115374648,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExNTM3NDY0OA==","user":{"login":"millerse","id":9950335,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5NTAzMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9950335?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/millerse","html_url":"https://github.com/millerse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/millerse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/millerse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/millerse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/millerse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/millerse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/millerse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/millerse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/millerse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/millerse/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-25T19:47:52Z","updated_at":"2015-06-25T19:47:52Z","body":"@jhpoelen I can.

So . . . here goes. \n\n**Seton 1929**\n@millerse thanks for taking the time to peek into the Seton 1929. Would you like me to create a repository to include the one interaction that you extracted: river otter (_Lutra canadensis_) kills beaver (_Castor canadensis_)? This way we have at least one reference to the Seton 1929 publication.\n\n**Kill interaction**\n@diatomsRcool I agree that killing and eating are separate interactions. I've created a separate issue for this in #143 .\n\n**annotating suspicious or dubious interactions**\nI imagined that GloBI would take a somewhat neutral stance on what is a \"correct\" or \"incorrect\" interaction to limit the scope of the project. I was hoping that GloBI would spur data curators of contributing datasets to take actions (and they have in the past). However in case of static resources or disputed interactions (like the #118 ), I do see the need to filter out, exclude or flag disputed interactions, similar to how GBIF flags records with \"spatial issues\". I am hoping that the GloBI community can figure out a mechanisms to make this work. I've created a separate issue to continue this discussion in #144 .\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/118920143/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/119294190","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/142#issuecomment-119294190","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/142","id":119294190,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExOTI5NDE5MA==","user":{"login":"millerse","id":9950335,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5NTAzMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9950335?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/millerse","html_url":"https://github.com/millerse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/millerse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/millerse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/millerse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/millerse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/millerse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/millerse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/millerse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/millerse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/millerse/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-07T18:31:07Z","updated_at":"2015-07-07T18:31:07Z","body":"@jhpoelen Sure.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/119294190/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/154133338","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/142#issuecomment-154133338","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/142","id":154133338,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NDEzMzMzOA==","user":{"login":"millerse","id":9950335,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5NTAzMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9950335?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/millerse","html_url":"https://github.com/millerse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/millerse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/millerse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/millerse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/millerse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/millerse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/millerse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/millerse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/millerse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/millerse/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-05T17:39:03Z","updated_at":"2015-11-05T17:39:03Z","body":"@jhpoelen Sorry for the delay.
