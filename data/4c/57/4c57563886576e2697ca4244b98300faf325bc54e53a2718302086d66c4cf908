In my mind, this is a form of deprecation. \r\n\r\nCurrently, datasets stick around even after they are deleted, because GloBI maintains a (temporary?) cache of interaction datasets. \r\n\r\nProposed is to introduce a method to mark datasets as \"deprecated\" in addition to pointing to a more recent version or alternate location of the datasets. This would have the advantage of keeping things around that may have been referenced in the past, while marking them as \"deprecated\" or \"please use something else\".
