The unexpected image of the catfish appeared because of the (incorrect) association of the name \"Acari\" with \"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6406267\" in addition to the expected link to \"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q19137\" \r\n\r\nGloBI uses wikidata to retrieve key images for linked taxa. In this case, the image was helpful to detect the suspicious wiki link. \r\n\r\nHoping to provide a root cause analysis and fix in the near future. \r\n\r\nPS. If Arctos has a way to provide openly accessibly thumbnail images for taxa, please let me know. I might be able to add Arctos as a taxon image provider. Might be a little more specific compared to wikidata.
