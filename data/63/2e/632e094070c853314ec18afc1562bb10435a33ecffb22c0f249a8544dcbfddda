To do this we've been using an API request like this:\r\n\r\nhttps://api.globalbioticinteractions.org/interaction?accordingTo=inaturalist&field=study_url&includeObservations=true&limit=10&skip=0\r\n\r\nAs of right now, that's not returning any results. As far as I can tell the DwC-A we generate for GLoBI exists and has data, and it looks like iNat records are still in GLoBI. Using the UI it seems like you might have changed the identifier that should be used with `accordingTo` so maybe we should be doing something like\r\n\r\nhttps://api.globalbioticinteractions.org/interaction?accordingTo=globi:globalbioticinteractions/inaturalist&field=study_url&includeObservations=true&limit=10&skip=0\r\n\r\nIs that right?
