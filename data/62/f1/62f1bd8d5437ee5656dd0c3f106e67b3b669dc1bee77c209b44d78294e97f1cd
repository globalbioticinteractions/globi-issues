I found that some of these names did not have mappings to UBERON, PO, FAO, ENVO in the interactions.tsv.gz dataset here (https://www.globalbioticinteractions.org/data). \r\n\r\nCrude way of reproducing this finding for BodyPartName: \r\n```gunzip -c interactions.tsv.gz | awk -F \"\\t\" '{print $33,$34,$73,$74}'```\r\n\r\nYou can see that some have ```no:match``` or no BodyPartId (```$33``` for source /```$73``` for target), but the names (```$34``` for source, ```$74``` for target) are there.\r\n\r\nI also searched a bit around the globi github repo and found this from 2018: https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/blob/main/eol-globi-taxon-resolver/src/main/resources/org/eol/globi/taxon/body-part-mapping.csv . If there is an updated version somewhere else, please let me know. \r\n\r\nIn the meantime, I tried to get these mappings automatically here - https://github.com/mdrishti/rdflib_trydb_globi/tree/main/ontology. The script here generated mostly sane mappings (https://github.com/mdrishti/rdflib_trydb_globi/blob/main/ontology/data/mappedBodyPartNamesGlobi.csv), but I still have to correct  soem of them manually, which is in-progress (https://github.com/mdrishti/rdflib_trydb_globi/blob/main/ontology/data/correctedBodyPartNamesGlobi.csv), the ones marked in ```#``` at the start of the line are probably the mis-matched ones. Note that these mappings are only for specific rows I extracted from the original ```interaction.tsv.gz``` file. The full list of unmapped terms is high, as I understand (~400 for BodyPartNames). I plan to do the same forLifeStageName and PhysiologicalStateName, both of which have fewer unmapped names.  \r\n\r\nI am not sure if this whole exercise is useful at all for globi, but thought I will share. Maybe there is already something obvious in the globi repo, which I have missed. If so, please let me know - this will help me guide my efforts better.\r\n\r\n-DT","closed_by":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/1031/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/1031/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
