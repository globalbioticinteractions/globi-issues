You're looking for trait_name=Symbiodinium clade. resource_id and resource_secondary_id both map to literature references in the resources file- I'm keeping both columns for the other trait records; apparently resource_id is the original source and resource_secondary_id means an aggregate data source where the record was proximally retrieved. Most of the other fields ending in \"_id\" are redundant as the associated value is spelled out in another column. The value column contains just the clade's alpha code, which you'll want to map, \"A\"->\"Symbiodinium A\" etc. I never did figure out the access or user_id columns. I figure user names may have been withheld for privacy. \r\n\r\nI'm still looking for a source to place Symbiodinium species within clades, which I won't need for this resource but might be nice to integrate our other resources with species level stuff. I'll post here if I find it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/454837017/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
