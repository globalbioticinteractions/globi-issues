Some of the URIs work, such as this one:\n\nhttp://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002440\n\nMany of the relations are formalized in terms of GO - for example, the above relation is defined to hold between a and b whenever a is a partner in a process p where p is a symbiosis process, and p also has partner b. We may also use PCO for this in future. But this formalization may be irrelevant to many people who just need a vocabulary of relations.\n\nThere are a lot of relations that are of no relevance to GLoBI folks - we can make a view of the ontology that only contains relevant relations.\n\nRelations can easily be requested, either through the RO tracker - or we could also use this tracker. We can also extend edit rights on the source ontology.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/43125736/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/43127050","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/66#issuecomment-43127050","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/66","id":43127050,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMTI3MDUw","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-05-14T19:36:27Z","updated_at":"2014-05-14T19:36:27Z","body":"Awesome!  Thanks for sharing. I'll make an effort to map existing (internal) interaction types to synonyms in RO . Also, we'll probably have to deprecate the old GloBI ontology draft to avoid confusion and deprecate usage in the ttl export with relevant terms.
