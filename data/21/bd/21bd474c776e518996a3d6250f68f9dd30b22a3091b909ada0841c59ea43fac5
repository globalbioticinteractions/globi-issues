I've updated the issue title with your suggestion.\r\n\r\nIn order to apply this rule, we'd need some specific way to detect records of parasitic taxa. Did you have any specific taxonomic matching criteria in mind (e.g., compare names against some parasite checklist)? Or are you suggesting to select by collection (e.g., if record from collection X and not a host, then . . . )? \r\n\r\nAm curious to hear your ideas on this record selection rule.
