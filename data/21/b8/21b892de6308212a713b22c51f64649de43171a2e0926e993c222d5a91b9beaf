Yes, that field should be populated and I have URI for all of the relations we are presently using. Need to fix and update. Should be able to update in the next few days so the URI appear. Will get back to you.\n\n---Also, please let me know if you'd like me to either move or reconfigure the bee and tri-trophic archives to upgrade to a more recent archive.\nA few things. We are continuing to add data to the tri-tropic archive and will be adding/updating through the summer at an advanced pace. I suspect we will add in 40 thousand more records before the end of June and many will be corrected. What do updates in GloBI look like?\n\nThe archives and the Associations Extension we are using are waiting for review from @iDigBio @godfoder. Some changes may occur for iDigBio in the process and the final published archive will move to a different server. If these changes are substantial, I can produce a different version of the archive for GloBI and iDigBio. \n\nSo here is a final and perhaps more fun and metaphysical issue. These data come directly from collection records and labels on specimens. So some of the data are wrong! Of course, even published data, based on old observations can be incorrect. Do you use any filtering or confidence methods for the records? I have been working with finding methods for filtering records and binning them based on frequency and a few heuristics. \n\nIn the simplest terms, if you see an association between a species and an associate 3 or > times, and if those are unique collecting events (not specimens at the same event), you can be quite confident in the association. However, this does reduce the number of associations and trims off some of the rarer (and perhaps more interesting) taxa.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/92982548/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/93018215","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/126#issuecomment-93018215","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/126","id":93018215,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDkzMDE4MjE1","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-14T18:53:26Z","updated_at":"2015-04-14T18:55:55Z","body":"@seltmann thanks for your detailed response. \n\n**about updates** GloBI updates every day or so changes in data sources should propagate in the order of days.

We also try to provide only the raw data as many of the interactions are unpublished to science and we are in the process of evaluating them.
