I eventually ended 'InteractionTypeName' for intepretability of the results but also because for some interactions, the InteractionTypeId showed a 'no:match'\r\n\r\n- What can you tell me about these interactions? Did the researchers propose these terms? Why don't they have an Id?\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2023-04-17 at 17 13 18](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38956533/232530220-d03e0ae9-af19-49fb-82c2-4ea6ccd0e12d.png)\r\n\r\nKind regards, \r\nBarbara Meulenbelt","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/888/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/888/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
