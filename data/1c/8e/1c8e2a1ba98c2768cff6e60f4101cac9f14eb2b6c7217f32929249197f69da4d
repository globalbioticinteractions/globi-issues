Spinger. 1216 pp. \"_. In the aphidsontheworldsplants website it is stated that _\"many of the new host records for palaearctic aphids added since our 1994 and 2006 books are from the major work by Holman (2009)\"_, so the aphidsontheworldsplants database includes the eCAPE data, whether eCAPE includes all of the aphidsontheworldsplants data i'm not sure. I'll ask Hana when/if she gets back to me!","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/1315248044/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/1315316274","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/449#issuecomment-1315316274","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/449","id":1315316274,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACXQt85OZiIy","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-15T13:32:15Z","updated_at":"2022-11-15T13:32:15Z","body":"@ZekeMarshall thanks for sharing - neat to see how many databases seem to survive by reuse.
