GloBI ingests geo information and normalizes it into a geo-coding ontology / vocabulary\n3. With the normalized geocodes, GloBI users can select areas of interest based on coordinates (latitude, longitude) and/or administrative areas (e.g. find me all mammals that are eaten in New York City, NY, USA).\n\nA coding scheme that looks somewhat useful is http://geonames.org .
