However, as you found, the fields are sparsely populated and are not exposed in the various web UIs (see #379). \r\n\r\nI hope your work on quality metrics can help inspire GloBI and researches to improve of methods to measure how \"good\" links are. GloBI now has basic measures like taxonomic name linking, ability to refute claims (see #376), cross reference claims across different data sources, and, more recently, integration with records from natural history collections (see https://www.globalbioticinteractions.org/2019/07/10/associating-with-natural-history-collections/ ) .","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/535056417/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/703963622","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/412#issuecomment-703963622","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/412","id":703963622,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwMzk2MzYyMg==","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-06T00:42:21Z","updated_at":"2020-10-06T00:42:21Z","body":"Olivier 2019 is now being indexed by GloBI via https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/olivier2019 .
