However, many do have kingdom name fields populated. \r\n2. I wrote used the apache spark shell to join the taxonCache.tsv.gz woith the sourceTaxonIds and targetTaxonIds fields in interaction.tsv.gz extracting only the kingdom rank if available. With this, I was able to create a kingdom2kingdom interaction table by sourceNamespace. The sourceNamespace is a proxy associated with the dataset from which the data was extracted.\r\n3. Some taxonomies, like NCBI have a different naming scheme for \"kingdom\" than others (e.g., ITIS, WORMS, GBIF, INAT_TAXON). To avoid inconsistencies, it might be wise to use ITIS, WORMS, GBIF, and INAT_TAXON taxonomies when attempting to join interactions.tsv.gz and taxonCache.tsv.gz .\r\n\r\nI've attached the preliminary results related to my experiments with  2. in attached kingdom2kingdom.tsv.txt . The first 4 lines look like:\r\n\r\nsourceKingdom | interactionTypeName | targetKingdomName | sourceNamespace\r\n-- | -- | -- | --\r\nChromista | hasHost | Animalia | millerse/Wardeh-et-al.-2015\r\nAnimalia | eats | Bacteria | hurlbertlab/dietdatabase\r\nAnimalia | eats | Chromista | jhpoelen/Dapstrom-integrated-database-and-portal-for-fish-stomach-records\r\n \r\nIs this the kind of information you are looking for? If not, please propose a mock data structure with some representative data that would suit your needs.\r\n\r\nAlso, please note that if you are running out of time or don't have the skills to take on joining big datasets, you might want to consider using the kingdom fields available directly via interactions.tsv.gz and focus on developing the downstream analysis and visualizations instead. \r\n\r\nCurious to hear your thoughts!\r\n\r\n[kingdom2kingdom.tsv.txt](https://github.com/jhpoelen/eol-globi-data/files/3041223/kingdom2kingdom.tsv.txt)\r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/479705261/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/480411515","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/391#issuecomment-480411515","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/391","id":480411515,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MDQxMTUxNQ==","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-05T20:27:12Z","updated_at":"2019-04-05T20:27:12Z","body":"In case you are interested: here's a gist that contains the code used to generate the kingdom2kingdom file, using apache spark 2.4, ubuntu linux and bash : https://gist.github.com/jhpoelen/9cac3897fc930b17fa6dcd0cacfc5ec2  ","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/480411515/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/993925639","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/391#issuecomment-993925639","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/391","id":993925639,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACXQt847PhoH","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-14T19:50:32Z","updated_at":"2021-12-14T19:50:32Z","body":"Closing stale issue. @DAntoszyk Please comments or share insights if this remains a concern.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/993925639/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
