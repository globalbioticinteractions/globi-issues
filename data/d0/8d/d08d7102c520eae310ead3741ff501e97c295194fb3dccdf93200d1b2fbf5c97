Plazi will take the spreadsheet information and use it to populate the Zenodo annotations as appropriate\r\n4. consider populate related identifier to link into GloBI using the DOI  . Pick a suitable Zenodo relation. \r\n5. Discuss Alex to add more general way to annotate \"biotic interactions\" and how to avoid massive amounts of annotations\r\n\r\nSee also https://www.globalbioticinteractions.org/plazi-zenodo/#collaborative-transcription .\r\n\r\nNext step - an example of Katja's transcription tables. \r\n\r\nfyi @mguidoti @myrmoteras @seltmann ","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/728464517/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
