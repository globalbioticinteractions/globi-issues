These are not, biologically speaking, known associations - they are _predicted_ associations with weak laboratory evidence. A really nice example you can check for yourself is anaconda paramyxovirus, which is recorded as human-associated in GLOBI because it's recorded as such in Virus-Host DB, because of e.g., HeLa cell line experiments that have been done with the virus. That couldn't be divined at this time from GLOBI without going to the source. I've spoken to the curators of that dataset about this, and while they've made the Comments field (where this info is stored) available on the FTP server (it wasn't previously), it's still not stored in a standardized way that pairs cell lines to hosts. They never built any sort of back-end reference table that pairs cell line to host origin, or flags non-cell-line records (e.g,. you don't want to throw out the influenza A - human association just because it's been cultured in human cell lines), and so no programmatic way to remove these data. So you might see something like\r\n\r\n```\r\nHomo sapiens        Anaconda paramyxovirus       Comments: \"Culture cell line: BHK21, HF, Calu-3, A549, Hep-2, Caco-2, HRT-18G, Huh-7, Hela, HEK, NT2, RD, SF268, His-1, MDCK, MDBK, RK13, 3T3, Dubca, LLC-MK2, Vero, VeroE6, CRFK, PK-15, RK3E, RMC,DF-1, C6/36 cells\" \r\n```\r\n\r\nand you wouldn't really be able to break it down to its finer parts: is the human record from cell lines, other evidence, or both? What hosts were from those other cell lines? Which cell lines are which hosts? \r\n\r\nAs a result, this is something that's been incredibly important to flag in GLOBI's indexing in VIRION (and is in an updated copy of the preprint I think may not have been posted to bioRxiv yet), because the R API to GLOBI doesn't retain source metadata, and while this is just a Virus-Host DB problem and not a broader GLOBI problem, users can't currently discriminate based on stringency for anything that comes from that API (including VIRION but also just... folks who call GLOBI data that way). In the VIRION paper currently under review, we warn users that this is an issue, one of many that we flag where users need to basically never-ever-ever use VIRION out of the box without any thought to filtering it down to appropriate use cases.\r\n\r\nThe reason this matters in terms of you indexing VIRION, then, is that because that R API process again discards provenance, we have a bit of a problem now for people who go to GLOBI to get VIRION, instead of coming to us directly. Now, VIRION contains those cell line experiments alongside viral isolation and they're all called VIRION, without any of the warning that those shouldn't be used together out of the box alongside much stronger evidence records. Anything VIRION becomes homogenous, and this isn't a fatal issue, but it's meant to be an example - one of many that could come up with the datasets indexing each other while GLOBI loses a tremendous amount of the metadata that makes VIRION unique and reiterates it as host-virus associations of equal levels of evidence. This similarly matters for everything from serological evidence to known quality control issues in GenBank host taxonomic data. \r\n\r\nThere's one final thing that compounds all of this, which is that while this release of VIRION doesn't include predicted probable associations from metagenomic data, that's absolutely still on the calendar for future releases - as it was included in early ones - and that will break any remaining degree to which GLOBI only includes \"known\" associations; those are pure predictions.\r\n\r\nThose are all reasons I would have given up-front not to index VIRION in GLOBI - as is the fact that this dataset isn't even appropriately citeable in its final form yet - but we're here now. I still think they're worth considering, given the stakes of host-virus research at the present moment, and the potential scope of damage that might be accomplished by out-of-the-box end users. These are the reasons we brought virologists into the room to create an entirely novel resource with new data structures - if we hadn't thought it merited that, we would've just tagged all these datasets for GLOBI indexing and saved ourselves a year of dev work!\r\n\r\nThat's part one of this thought.\r\n\r\nThen, there's an entire second problem, which is way goofier, but still worth flagging. By indexing VIRION in GLOBI, you've also doubled the size of VIRION artificially as of the next time I run the pipeline, while also scrubbing the metadata that all the non-GLOBI VIRION records have that address these evidence strength issues. There are practical problems there for the science, and also conceptual problems in terms of proper and fair attribution to source datasets; if VIRION and GLOBI index eachother recursively and cite each other as sources, without records of how things pingponged into both, source datasets are losing credit for records as that happens. But it also just makes our dataset bigger, less tractable, and harder to update.\r\n\r\nThe problem boils down, again, to the R API that we use (our entire pipeline is written in R); it makes it possible for us to reproducibly call new GLOBI data, but if VIRION data is folded into that, without the ability to stratify by data provenance, we can't pull the GLOBI-washed VIRION back out of VIRION and prevent that weird doubling-with-de-metadata-ing. We also already have some weird issues with loss-of-provenance in the data pull in the same spirit of credit and attribution, e.g., Host-Virus DB and DBatVir are both great sources we'd love to more directly credit, but it's all GLOBI for us right now. Those aren't high priorities but I see a chance to tackle them while we have this conversation.\r\n\r\nI see three possible solutions that would prevent that from becoming a lasting headache:\r\n1. I could render GLOBI static in VIRION before the next update, and never update that source again, though defeats the purpose of both of our exercises, I think\r\n2. The R API to GLOBI could change to include provenance as a retained field, which I think would be most in the spirit of open science and solves multiple dimensions of the credit & attribution problem, though I still think you may want to consider some of the virology-related concerns - one of GLOBI's biggest strengths is the universality of the template and the ability to consider multiple overlaid ecological modes, and I've always loved that, but host-virus networks _are_ fundamentally different from other kinds of interaction network\r\n3. You could un-index VIRION, which has a very different set of aims than GLOBI and is designed from first principles of virology before ecology. I think that might be the best way to prevent ecologists from using these data without careful attention to the problems in them (again, the manuscript goes into a ton of depth) but I suspect 2's probably the option that makes the most people happy.\r\n \r\nHappy for any thoughts but in the future, a turnaround of 48 hours might be a little fast for those of us working in the virus world right now :)\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/943612983/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/943652472","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/665#issuecomment-943652472","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/665","id":943652472,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACXQt844Pv54","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-14T19:18:25Z","updated_at":"2021-10-14T19:30:27Z","body":"@cjcarlson thanks for your detailed comments.
