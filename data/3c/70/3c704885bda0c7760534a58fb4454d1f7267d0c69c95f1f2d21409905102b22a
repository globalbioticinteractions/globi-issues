For example, Lepidochelys kempii, a species level observation, includes taxon path names and IDs for it’s family, genus, and species, but not for it’s Kingdom, Phylum, Class, or Order. \r\n\r\nIs it possible to force the inclusion of ranks higher than the observation level. e.g. species level observations would have coverage for kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species. While and observation at the order level would have coverage from kingdom, phylum, class, and order.\r\n\r\nIf the information is not already part of globi could it be added using EOL’s, or the other available taxonomic databases, api?\r\n\r\nIf possible it would also be helpful to include a standard set of ranks from the other available taxonomies shown in sourceTaxonIds: Worms, WD, OTT, etc. The attached file shows what that could look like.\r\n\r\n[globi_github_issue.zip](https://github.com/jhpoelen/eol-globi-data/files/3036821/globi_github_issue.zip)\r\n\r\nWe’d like to be able to group lower level interactions at higher taxonomic ranks in order to generate probabilities based on the grouped data. Grouping the whole data by higher ranks will allow us to use a large number of observation to support general statements at each rank level. As an example, with data grouped by kingdom we can calculate the probability that an organism eats a plant given it’s own kingdom.\r\n\r\nP(Eats_Plantae | Plantae)  or P(Eats_Plantae | Animalia) or P(Eats_Plantae | Fungi) \r\n\r\nCreating these conditional probabilities at many levels count be a good way of generating evidence to support or reject specific claims.\r\n\r\nThanks.","closed_by":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/391/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/391/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
