It appears that common names for the species as reported on EOL taxon page at http://eol.org/pages/2942517/names/common_names includes \"Sand\". An attempt to reproduce this behavior failed, suggesting that the name \"Sand\" no longer resolves to said species.\r\n\r\nI'll remove the recorded taxonomic links, so that the names can be resolved again. Will close issue once the changes have propagated.\r\n\r\nHope this helps and thanks for your patience. \r\n\r\nPS. Note that NODC:8857041701 taxon point to both ```Sand sole Psettichthys melanostictus``` and ```Misc Flatfish```. ```Misc Flatfish``` was resolved to Fenestraria rhopalophylla because GloBI assumed that taxon ids are unique point to a single taxon concept. Also GloBI uses taxon ids first, and taxon name strings second in name resolving. In the end, this explains why ```Misc Flatfish``` resolved to Fenestraria rhopalophylla. \r\n\r\nfrom taxonMap.tsv (see http://globalbioticinteractions.org/references)\r\n```tsv\r\nprovidedId providedName resolvedId resolvedName\r\n\tSand siliceous\tEOL:2942517\tFenestraria rhopalophylla\r\n\tSand siliceous\tOTT:613311\tFenestraria rhopalophylla\r\n\tSand siliceous\tGBIF:7329187\tFenestraria rhopalophylla\r\n\tSand siliceous\tNCBI:188818\tFenestraria rhopalophylla\r\n\tSand\tEOL:2942517\tFenestraria rhopalophylla\r\n\tSand\tOTT:613311\tFenestraria rhopalophylla\r\n\tSand\tGBIF:7329187\tFenestraria rhopalophylla\r\n\tSand\tNCBI:188818\tFenestraria rhopalophylla\r\n\tSand calcareous\tEOL:2942517\tFenestraria rhopalophylla\r\n\tSand calcareous\tOTT:613311\tFenestraria rhopalophylla\r\n\tSand calcareous\tGBIF:7329187\tFenestraria rhopalophylla\r\n\tSand calcareous\tNCBI:188818\tFenestraria rhopalophylla\r\n\tSAND\tEOL:2942517\tFenestraria rhopalophylla\r\n\tSAND\tOTT:613311\tFenestraria rhopalophylla\r\n\tSAND\tGBIF:7329187\tFenestraria rhopalophylla\r\n\tSAND\tNCBI:188818\tFenestraria rhopalophylla\r\n\tsand\tEOL:2942517\tFenestraria rhopalophylla\r\n\tsand\tOTT:613311\tFenestraria rhopalophylla\r\n\tsand\tGBIF:7329187\tFenestraria rhopalophylla\r\n\tsand\tNCBI:188818\tFenestraria rhopalophylla\r\n\tSand (muddy)\tEOL:2942517\tFenestraria rhopalophylla\r\n\tSand (muddy)\tOTT:613311\tFenestraria rhopalophylla\r\n\tSand (muddy)\tGBIF:7329187\tFenestraria rhopalophylla\r\n\tSand (muddy)\tNCBI:188818\tFenestraria rhopalophylla\r\nNODC:8857041701\tSand sole Psettichthys melanostictus\tEOL:2942517\tFenestraria rhopalophylla\r\nNODC:8857041701\tSand sole Psettichthys melanostictus\tOTT:613311\tFenestraria rhopalophylla\r\nNODC:8857041701\tSand sole Psettichthys melanostictus\tGBIF:7329187\tFenestraria rhopalophylla\r\nNODC:8857041701\tSand sole Psettichthys melanostictus\tNCBI:188818\tFenestraria rhopalophylla\r\nNODC:8857041701\tMisc Flatfish\tEOL:2942517\tFenestraria rhopalophylla\r\nNODC:8857041701\tMisc Flatfish\tOTT:613311\tFenestraria rhopalophylla\r\nNODC:8857041701\tMisc Flatfish\tGBIF:7329187\tFenestraria rhopalophylla\r\nNODC:8857041701\tMisc Flatfish\tNCBI:188818\tFenestraria rhopalophylla\r\n```\r\n\r\n![fenestrariaeol2942517](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1084872/25290201/bc2711de-2681-11e7-9e1e-6882f718b97f.png)\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/296262943/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/296266291","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/292#issuecomment-296266291","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/292","id":296266291,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NjI2NjI5MQ==","user":{"login":"jsimons9","id":2206737,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDY3Mzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2206737?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsimons9","html_url":"https://github.com/jsimons9","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsimons9/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsimons9/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsimons9/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsimons9/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsimons9/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsimons9/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsimons9/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsimons9/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsimons9/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-21T18:21:50Z","updated_at":"2017-04-21T18:25:31Z","body":"Hi Jorrit,\r\n\r\n  I am a little confused.
