https://depot.globalbioticinteractions.org/reviews/[namespace]/README.txt services as a started point for now, although future improvements to visualization of review reports can be imagined.\r\n\r\nAlso, note that review badges are generated as part of the process to make it easy to distinguish between reviews with no notes (ok sign, see attached) and notes (conversion bubble with yellow background) . The idea is to see a review as the starting point of a conversation rather than some kind of normative pass/fail mechanism. \r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2020-12-30 12-40-42](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1084872/103379956-44873f80-4a9c-11eb-9864-d4088d74ab4a.png)\r\n![Screenshot from 2020-12-30 12-40-36](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1084872/103379959-44873f80-4a9c-11eb-8021-c3207b145d9d.png)\r\n\r\n(please note that badges are being generated as we speak, so some may come up as broken links for a few hours)\r\n\r\n@seltmann - if desired, this review batch process can be relatively easily run on a separate server or laptop, in addition to the globi servers and travis build processes.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2020-12-30 12-40-04](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1084872/103379931-320d0600-4a9c-11eb-8194-0e5b95f004d8.png)\r\n![Screenshot from 2020-12-30 12-39-38](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1084872/103379933-333e3300-4a9c-11eb-88d0-4622a3e80c0b.png)\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/752752353/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
