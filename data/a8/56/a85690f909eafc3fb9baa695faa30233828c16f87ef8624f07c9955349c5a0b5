Interesting to see the mixing of frequencies (e.g.,11, 4, 2), sex names (e.g., male, female) and life stage terms (e.g., juveniles).\n\nOne way to go about it is to expand the related claims.\n\ne.g., \n\nsource | interactionType | target | targetSexName\n--- | --- | --- | ---\ncat |  eats |  mouse |  11 males, 4 female, 2 juveniles \n\nwould turn into \n\nsource | interactionType | target | frequencyOfOccurrence | targetSexName | targetLifeStage\n--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---\ncat |  eats |  mouse |  11 | males | NA\ncat |  eats |  mouse |   4 | female |  NA\ncat |  eats |  mouse |  2  | NA | juveniles \n\nI can see how authors want to combine all these individual claims to save space.

Sometime back, I implemented a reasonable solution incorporating most of what you mentioned in a couple of python functions here: https://github.com/digital-botanical-gardens-initiative/rdflib_trydb_globi/blob/main/src/functions/matchNamesBiologicalGender.py\n\nIn the final output, it looks something like the first table from your previous response, but with IDs : \n\n\nsource |\tinteractionType |\ttarget |\ttargetSexName | targetSexId |\n------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |\ncat |\teats\t| mouse\t| 11 males, 4 female, 2 juveniles | 11 PATO:0000384, 4 PATO:0000383, 2 PATO:0001190 |\neagle | eats | squirell | female, famale, f | 3 PATO:0000383 |\neagle | eats | squirell | m, f | 1 PATO:0000383,1 PATO:0000384 |\n\n\nAlthough, I agree the second table from your response will be more useful in a tsv/csv format. However, if one converts the above information to rdf-triples (which is my intended use-case), the representation in the tsv/csv-file only needs to be arranged in a legible-enough, spell-checked, and ID-mapped format.\n\nSee also a list here:  https://github.com/digital-botanical-gardens-initiative/rdflib_trydb_globi/blob/main/ontology/data/globi/correctedBiologicalSexNames.tsv, where I mapped all obscure/non-obscure genders listed in GloBI interactions.tsv \n\nI would love to incorporate this in GloBI. However, I am java-illiterate ;-)! Converting the python code to a standalone tool is one option and then the tool can be called within the GloBI's java code to map. Or maybe just the mapping-list (https://github.com/digital-botanical-gardens-initiative/rdflib_trydb_globi/blob/main/ontology/data/globi/correctedBiologicalSexNames.tsv) can be included in GloBI to map biological genders. \n\nLet me know your thoughts.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/2671091860/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
