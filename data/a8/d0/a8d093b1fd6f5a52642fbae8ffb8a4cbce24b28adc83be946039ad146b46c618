In recent years, the One Health community has been calling for more integration of environmental expertise in what was traditionally a veterinary medicine–dominated field. In parallel, the field of biodiversity monitoring has made substantial progress, in response to both a mounting biodiversity crisis and the adoption of the Kunming-Montréal Global Biodiversity Framework (which focuses on integrating monitoring of biodiversity as a core component of our global ability to take evidence-driven policy decisions). Therefore, a tight integration between the fields of biodiversity monitoring and biosurveillance is not only achievable, but also mutually beneficial. In this presentation, I will review important lessons learned in establishing the Kunming-Montréal Global Biodiversity Framework, and how they directly translate to the surveillance of zoonotic diseases. I frame these advances in terms of concrete steps that can be taken to further integrate the two fields.\n\n\n<img width=\"1106\" height=\"640\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3bbb6827-8f30-48b7-af4b-f84f4c7ce372\" />","closed_by":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/1107/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/1107/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"}
