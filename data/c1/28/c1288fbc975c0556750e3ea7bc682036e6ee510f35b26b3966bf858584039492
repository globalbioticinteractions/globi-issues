The database is originally structured as a Wikibase instance on Wikibase.cloud (https://ppsdb.wikibase.cloud/wiki/Main_Page)\r\n\r\nFor integration with GloBI, I've set up an export (using a SPARQL query) of a subset of the original database to TSV format, following the field names in the GloBI template repository: https://github.com/kbseah/ppsdb-globi-export, though I haven't turned off the \"deprecated\" flag yet in the `globi.json` file.\r\n\r\nMy question to you is: how can I include more than one `sourceTaxonId` external identifier per `sourceTaxon`, and likewise for `targetTaxonId`? Taxa in the database are linked to NCBI Taxonomy identifiers and Wikidata items where possible; some are linked to both, to only one of the two, or to neither. Having more than one identifier can help with disambiguation of some of the names, but in the tabular format it appears that only one identifier is possible per `sourceTaxon`.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you have some ideas on alternative ways to index my database in GloBI?\r\n\r\nThanks for your help!","closed_by":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/994/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/994/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
