Synonymic-topographical catalog\") by Adriano-Lorenzo Bonomi-Cazzuoli, Italian entomologist from San Felice sul Panaro (Modena - Emilia-Romagna) [has just been published](https://www.google.it/books/edition/I_calcidoidei_d_Italia_e_regioni_adiacen/aS2GzgEACAAJ?hl=en)\r\nVolume II is on the Mediterranean Region, and follows the publication of Volume I Padano and Apennine Sectors, in 2016, which had already been taken as a reference for some new reports by the [Universal Chalcidoidea Database](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/our-science/data/chalcidoids/database/browseRefs.dsml?AUTHORqtype=contains&AUTHOR=bonomi&YEAR=)\r\nIn fact, from this first book there would be many interesting observations to include, unfortunately not yet included.\r\nI'll just give an example from the faunal list of padano sectors on page 316:\r\n__\"_Polynema palustre Soyka 1956_ Lygaeidae eggs on Carex elata (Adri!) (9) *\"__\r\nas specified in the book means\r\n- (Adri!): species bred, as far as I Know, for the first time and that consequently I first described in part its biology\r\n- *: First to Italy, according to Italian wildlife checklist\r\n\r\nThis datum is connected with the faunal list divided by year, locality and taxonomic families, where in page 219, I find that _Polynema palustre_ was found at the mouth of the Panaro river, which flows into the Po river in the province of Ferrara, in 1999.\r\nIt is probably from there that he was also bred. But I can ask Adriano if he can find the notes: we have been collaborating together for 3 years for agroecology projects.\r\nIf I search for _Polynema palustre_ I find that:\r\n- in the Universal Chalcidoidea Database there is the species (Soyka who reviewed the species in the 40s and 50s), but it is not reported in Italy [UCD Polynema palustre](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/our-science/data/chalcidoids/database/detail.dsml?VALSPECIES=palustre&VALDATE=1940&FamilyCode=MY&HOMCODE=0&ValidAuthBracket=true&VALGENUS=Polynema&TAXONCODE=Polyne+palusSb&VALAUTHOR=%28Soyka%29+&searchPageURL=indexValidName%2edsml%3famp%3bamp%3bamp%3bGenus%3dPolynema%26Species%3dpalustre%26amp%3bamp%3bamp%3bindex%3dValidName%26amp%3bamp%3bamp%3bGenusqtype%3dequals%26amp%3bamp%3bamp%3bSpeciesqtype%3dequals%26amp%3bamp%3bamp%3bFamilyqtype%3dequals&listPageURL=validName%2edsml%3famp%3bamp%3bamp%3bGenus%3dPolynema%26Species%3dpalustre%26amp%3bamp%3bamp%3bindex%3dValidName%26amp%3bamp%3bamp%3bGenusqtype%3dequals%26amp%3bamp%3bamp%3bSpeciesqtype%3dequals%26amp%3bamp%3bamp%3bFamilyqtype%3dequals&tab=distribution)\r\n- completely missing in the [Natural History Museum Data portal](https://data.nhm.ac.uk/)\r\n- while there is in [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/species/1367037) which probably connects directly to the UCD (view the subtitle \"source\")\r\n\r\nSo finally I believe that a huge effort I feel that I have the mission to try to insert the data of this work by Adriano within the GBIF and GLOBI portals.\r\nWho can help me?\r\nP.S .: Adriano has just sent a hard copy of the second volume to the Natural History Museum (as he did for the first in 2016)","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/691/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/691/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
