Ficus is both a plant and a gastropod. Is this a usecase for your \"refute\" template? (edited) ```\r\n\r\nmy reply:\r\n\r\n```@Quentin Groom Thanks for pointing this out. Please record the issue at https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/new with example. And yes, this is an excellent example in which you (as an expert) can refute claims like \"flowers of gastropods are visited by bats\" :slightly_smiling_face:. Homonyms are expected to cause a fuss (as usual) and detection method exist beyond spot checking. e.g., https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.164 .```\r\n\r\nI realized that many homonyms might be hard to spot / detect for humans, even though the name linkages help to easily detect them computationally. \r\n\r\nIn the case of ```Ficus```, Nomer (see https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/nomer), a globi name matching tool, nicely reports the homonyms when using ```$ echo -e \"\\tFicus\" | nomer append``` like:\r\n\r\nprovidedId | providedName | linktype | resolvedId | resolvedName | resolvedRank | resolvedCommonNames | resolvedHierachy | resolvedHierachyIds | resolvedHierachyRanks \r\n-- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | --\r\n  | Ficus | SAME_AS | ITIS:19081 | Ficus | genus |   | Plantae \\| Viridiplantae \\| Streptophyta \\| Embryophyta \\| Tracheophyta \\| Spermatophytina \\| Magnoliopsida \\| Rosanae \\| Rosales \\| Moraceae \\| Ficus | ITIS:202422 \\| ITIS:954898 \\| ITIS:846494 \\| ITIS:954900 \\| ITIS:846496 \\| ITIS:846504 \\| ITIS:18063 \\| ITIS:846548 \\| ITIS:24057 \\| ITIS:19063 \\| ITIS:19081 | kingdom \\| subkingdom \\| infrakingdom \\| superphylum \\| phylum \\| subphylum \\| class \\| superorder \\| order \\| family \\| genus\r\n  | Ficus | SAME_AS | ITIS:73159 | Ficus | genus |   | Animalia \\| Bilateria \\| Protostomia \\| Lophozoa \\| Mollusca \\| Gastropoda \\| Neotaenioglossa \\| Ficidae \\| Ficus | ITIS:202423 \\| ITIS:914154 \\| ITIS:914155 \\| ITIS:914159 \\| ITIS:69458 \\| ITIS:69459 \\| ITIS:566851 \\| ITIS:73158 \\| ITIS:73159 | kingdom \\| subkingdom \\| infrakingdom \\| superphylum \\| phylum \\| class \\| order \\| family \\| genus\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, when providing a taxonomic context like Plantae, via ```$ echo -e \"\\tPlantae | Ficus\"``` a conflict no longer occurs.\r\n\r\nTo help more easily detect naming issues, I am thinking to label taxa that have inconsistent linkages (e.g., homonyms or other ambiguous links). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/495/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/495/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
