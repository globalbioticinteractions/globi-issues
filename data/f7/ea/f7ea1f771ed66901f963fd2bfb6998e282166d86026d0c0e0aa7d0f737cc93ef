The changes should propagate is a day or two. After that, we need to point EOL-GloBI harvest to the new resource. Also, I'd like to discuss the \"avoid relying on the EOL API\" in person some time in the near future.\n\nI double checked the taxon information related to page 3741790 (example that Anne gave). The information related as returned by EOL API looks pretty healthy:\n\n```\nname - \"Quesada\"    \nrank - \"Genus\"\nexternalId - \"EOL:3741790\"\ntaxon path - \"Animalia | Bilateria | Protostomia | Ecdysozoa | Arthropoda | Hexapoda | Insecta | Pterygota | Neoptera | Paraneoptera | Hemiptera | Auchenorrhyncha | Cicadomorpha | Cicadoidea | Cicadidae | Cicadinae | Hyantiini | Quesada\"   \n```\n\nThanks again for bringing up the issue!\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/46070684/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/46187192","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/77#issuecomment-46187192","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/77","id":46187192,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2MTg3MTky","user":{"login":"jhammock","id":3026567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMjY1Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3026567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhammock","html_url":"https://github.com/jhammock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhammock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhammock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhammock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhammock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhammock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhammock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhammock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhammock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhammock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-06-16T14:43:42Z","updated_at":"2014-06-16T14:43:42Z","body":"Jorrit, do I read you right that there's a new url for the resource?
