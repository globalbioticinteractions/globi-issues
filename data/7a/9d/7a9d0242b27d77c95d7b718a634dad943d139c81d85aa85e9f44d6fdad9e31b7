Sometimes we have good info on the reason they chose to euthanize (most of the RMRP ones), but can't necessarily attribute a cause to that injury. Some of those we could reason, e.g., that the injuries are consistent with a vehicle strike. But that would take some dedicated evaluations that would be difficult to put into an algorithm. I think 'killed by euthanizia' works for now.
