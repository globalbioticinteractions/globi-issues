And, just to emphasize - there's many improvement that can be made to the triplified view into GloBI. Please also note that Elton's [Nanopublications support](https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/wiki/Nanopubs) uses a slightly different model than the one exposed via the sparql endpoint.
