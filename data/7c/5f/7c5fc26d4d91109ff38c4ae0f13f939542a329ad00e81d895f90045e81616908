\r\n\r\nI'll continue with your example\r\ninput:\r\nHomo sapiens eats Canis lupus\r\nHere, we see the name of the taxa, sometimes 'Homo sapiens' will have a EOL code, sometimes a GBIF etc. so what we might see in the data is:\r\n\r\nId                              Name                   Interaction          Id                 Name              SourceTaxonGenusId      TargetTaxonGenusId\r\nEOL:XXX                  Homo sapiens    eats                     EOL:XXX     Canis Lupus   EOL:XXXX                         EOL:XXXX\r\nGBIF:XXX                 Homo sapiens    eats                     GBIF:XXX    Canis Lupus   GBIF:XXXX                        GBIF:XXXX\r\nEOL:XXX                  Homo sapiens    eats                     GBIF:XXX    Canis Lupus   INIT_TAXON:XX                EOL:XXXX\r\nINAT_TAXON:XXX   Homo sapiens    eats                     EOL:XXX     Canis Lupus   EOL:XXXXX                      GBIF:XXXX\r\n\r\nNow, this all refers to the same Homo sapiens and the same Canis Lupus, but all have different codes. If I would take the GBIFid as id for this interaction and find other interactions that include Homo sapiens and there Homo Sapiens has a EOL id, then in making my model, they do not refer to the same taxa as they have different codes. Also the order, family and genera \r\n\r\nWhat I would like to have as output something like this:\r\nId                Name                   Interaction             Id                 Name             sourceGenusId       targetTaxonGenusId\r\none code   Homo sapiens     eats                        one code    Canis Lupus  one code                 one code\r\n\r\nEvery interaction that I will find in my dataset that contains 'Homo sapiens' needs to have the same code, it doesn't matter whether its EOL, GBIF, etc.\r\nWhat also would be ok is to have a string containing a few different identifiers liek (name, id etc) (like the output of nomer)\r\n\r\nI hope this is clear ;)\r\n\r\nKind regards, \r\nBarbara Meulenbelt\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br class=\"Apple-interchange-newline\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/1280689934/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/1280738384","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/826#issuecomment-1280738384","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/826","id":1280738384,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACXQt85MVoRQ","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-17T11:54:35Z","updated_at":"2022-10-17T11:54:35Z","body":"@BarbaraMeulenbelt thanks for taking the time to provide a worked out example.

I am going to let that run now and I will let you know if it works :)\r\n\r\nAlso, not neccessarily related to this issue, I have 2 questions about things I noticed. \r\n1: When I started working with Globi I expected only 'species' interactions results. When I printed the different ranks that were present in the dataset I was surprised. \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38956533/198572475-9bae02f0-761d-41c2-86e2-be757fca7d82.png)\r\nFor my thesis I am in contact with a scientist at Naturalis and I asked him till what rank I should include taxa to be relevant for my model to predict species interactions. I decided for my model that I will exclude everything above family and then maybe see if including taxa with rank 'order' enhance my model. He told me that everything above that might be too general for my model. Now I am wondering how the results of taxa with ranks like 'order', 'kingdom', 'phylum' etc. come to exist in the data. For instance a relationship between a species and a class, or between a family and a kingdom etc. Are these deduced from other interactions?\r\n\r\n2: I printed these two columns together because I was wanted to look into 'interactsWith' as it does not tell you anything about _how_ they interact. What I saw is that the corresponding link to 'interact with' is http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002437 but if you click on the link it shows that this is the link for 'bioticallyInteractsWith'. \r\nand that 'interactsWith' has a different link, http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002434.

In my experience, these are the kinds of exchanges that will help work towards better ways to share interaction data. \r\n\r\nYou asked:\r\n> Are these deduced from other interactions?\r\n\r\nIn my experience, the granularity of taxonomic determination depends on the datasets that was indexed, or the specific circumstance in which the interaction claim was documented. For instance, bee specialists may know that the bees they study are known to pollinate plants from a specific family, but don't care about what species from that family. So, these specialists may not bother to identify the plant below a certain taxa. Many other reasons exist why the taxonomic classification maybe at a higher taxonomic rank. Generally, the interaction claims are deduced from the actual interaction that occurred. But, the recording of these interaction observations is far from perfect.\r\n\r\n > Is 'bioticallyInteractWith' changed by 'interactsWith' in the csv file because it has the same meaning?\r\n\r\nGood point! GloBI uses interactsWith to label the interaction term biotically interacts with (see https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/blob/e1b7f32efbe0a686b2fd9cf97688341169e79635/eol-globi-lib/src/main/java/org/eol/globi/domain/InteractType.java#L16) . So, yes, the label should probably be changed to bioticallyInteractsWith. And, this is why I think it is important to include the term IRI (e.g., http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002437) along with their labels. In my mind, labels are just shorthand for the actual definitions as referenced by their IRI. Labels are for humans, IRIs are for machines.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/1295030024/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/1297011321","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/826#issuecomment-1297011321","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/826","id":1297011321,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACXQt85NTtJ5","user":{"login":"BarbaraMeulenbelt","id":38956533,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4OTU2NTMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38956533?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BarbaraMeulenbelt","html_url":"https://github.com/BarbaraMeulenbelt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BarbaraMeulenbelt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BarbaraMeulenbelt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BarbaraMeulenbelt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BarbaraMeulenbelt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BarbaraMeulenbelt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BarbaraMeulenbelt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BarbaraMeulenbelt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BarbaraMeulenbelt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BarbaraMeulenbelt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-31T12:25:28Z","updated_at":"2022-10-31T12:25:53Z","body":"Thank you for your answers, they are very informative. \r\n\r\nRegarding the 'interactsWith'/'bioticallyInteractsWith', isn't it still very vague what the interaction is?

Is this OBO relationship given to interactions where is not clear hów they interact but it is known thát they interact?\r\n\r\nYes, interactsWith/bioticallyInteractsWith or even coOccursWith are used to document interaction claims that are either intentionally or unintentionally vague. For example, parasitologists use \"ex\" notation to denote the host of a parasite specimen. This \"ex\" can mean different things to different people: for instance, to me, a non-parasitologist, it may mean \"found on\", which is a weak indicator of some interaction. So, I'd translate the term \"ex\" to \"coOccursWith\", or \"foundOn\". But, an expert that is familiar with the collection/dataset in which the \"ex\" is found, may be very specific like: this parasite was parasitizing the larvea of bees in a bee nest. \r\n\r\nSo, the short answer is: the interpretation of an interaction claim can vary depending who you talk to.\r\n\r\nGreat to hear that your laptop was running overtime. Matching millions of names can be quite computationally intense. And, yes, the screenshot you shared looks normal. Perhaps you can ask your university to get some server space to run this using [```nohup```](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nohup) or some other background process. Otherwise, you can rent a server somewhere (that's what I do). If all these things are a bit intimidating or not possibly somehow, please let me know an I can see if I can get you access to the GloBI server somehow.
