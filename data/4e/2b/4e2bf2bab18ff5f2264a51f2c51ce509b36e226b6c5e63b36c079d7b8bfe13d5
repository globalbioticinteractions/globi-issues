However, support for resolving citations related to pubmed/ genbank ids/urls is not yet implemented. This makes it hard for humans to read citations like \"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22177712\". Suggest to include resolve bibliographic reference associated with pubmed/genbank ids like the one rendered for the link itself. \n\n![screen shot 2016-05-05 at 10 48 11 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1084872/15051716/e63f0c2a-12ae-11e6-81d2-6627a989f03d.png)\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/223/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/223/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
