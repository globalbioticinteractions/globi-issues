Her statement has a generated trusty URI: http://example.com/Z .\r\n\r\nNow, provided that GloBI has access to John's and Alice's statements, the two statements can be associated through http://example.com/X without having to change the original statement. Also, anyone that happens to make the same statements (either John's or Alice's) can recreate the associated URIs and allow for the same associations, recreating the original result. \r\n\r\nThis establishes a (distributed and reproducible) method to publish/annotate (or in any other way relate) statements without the need for a centralized ID/URI issuing authority. Example of annotations specific to GloBI could be: supporting evidence (X supports Y), refuting evidence (X is inconsistent with Y), or just a comments (X is a comment on Y). \r\n\r\nFor more info, also see a GloBI [Nanopub example](../wiki/Nanopubs) .\r\n\r\n\r\n ","closed_by":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/291/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/291/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
