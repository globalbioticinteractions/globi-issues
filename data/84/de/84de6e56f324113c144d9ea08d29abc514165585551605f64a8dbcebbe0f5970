Curious to hear your thoughts. Also, if you are interested in showing that this specimen was indexed by GloBI, you can use something like https://api.globalbioticinteractions.org/exists?accordingTo=https%3A%2F%2Fdb.fieldmuseum.org%2Fb0515046-18af-49a6-9bd9-ad5e23e099e8 . If this returns \"OK\", then GloBI knows about it, otherwise, it'll return a 404. \r\n\r\nCurious to hear your thoughts!\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n1. find indexed field museum interactions via https://www.globalbioticinteractions.org/?accordingTo=globi%3Aglobalbioticinteractions%2Ffmnh&interactionType=ecologicallyRelatedTo . see attached image \r\n![Screenshot from 2021-09-21 23-35-01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1084872/134294420-7fb885f7-5a90-415c-9b49-e427617086ee.png)\r\n\r\n2. then, click on document emoji next to occurrence id in \"Supported by\" (e.g., b0515046-18af-49a6-9bd9-ad5e23e099e8)\r\n3. the url https://db.fieldmuseum.org/b0515046-18af-49a6-9bd9-ad5e23e099e8 redirects to https://collections-botany.fieldmuseum.org/catalogue/4332571 \r\n4. specimen landing page is shown (see attached image) \r\n![Screenshot from 2021-09-21 23-34-48](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1084872/134294365-29a2150a-2fc3-4bb7-a63d-108547f0467e.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, you can click on the hour-glass to search for that specific specimen within GloBI.
