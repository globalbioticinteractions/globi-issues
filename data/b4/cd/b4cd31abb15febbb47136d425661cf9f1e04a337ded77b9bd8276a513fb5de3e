good! @jhpoelen \r\n\r\nWhen are the bee family names applied to the record? Is this also based on DiscoverLife? I would expect the higher taxonomy in the output to also be based on the catalog/s that I am using to do the filtering. \r\n\r\nA next step will then be to update the synonyms with the current valid names for the bees also based on Discover Life. I suspect this would be a column added to each row rather than a replacement of the verbatim name. Eventually this update will want to be done with other catalogs as well, such as world flora online for the associated plant taxa.\r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/2166606502/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/2166630934","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/984#issuecomment-2166630934","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/984","id":2166630934,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACXQt86BJCoW","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-13T19:37:40Z","updated_at":"2024-06-13T19:37:40Z","body":"@seltmann thanks!\r\n\r\n> When are the bee family names applied to the record?\r\n\r\nin https://github.com/Big-Bee-Network/select-bee-interactions.sh/blob/0ca199f682ed5e24aec8ca30031cbabd1723d655/select_bee_interactions.sh#L90\r\n\r\nand \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Big-Bee-Network/select-bee-interactions.sh/blob/0ca199f682ed5e24aec8ca30031cbabd1723d655/select_bee_interactions.sh#L91\r\n\r\nthe source and target taxonomic alignments are appended to the provided table. \r\n\r\nThen, only lines with at least one successful alignment (i.e., not `NONE`) are selected in the table with the appended rows. \r\n\r\nAfter that, in https://github.com/Big-Bee-Network/select-bee-interactions.sh/blob/0ca199f682ed5e24aec8ca30031cbabd1723d655/select_bee_interactions.sh#L93 , only lines containing a bee family name are included. \r\n\r\nFinally, the appended rows are truncated in https://github.com/Big-Bee-Network/select-bee-interactions.sh/blob/0ca199f682ed5e24aec8ca30031cbabd1723d655/select_bee_interactions.sh#L94. \r\n\r\nFor some reason, I thought the final step would be useful, but now I wonder whether we should keep the appended names so you can see the details of the alignment in the final project.\r\n\r\nWould you like to skip the last step to truncate the appended (or aligned) names?
