@seltmann @zaspelj SCAN is now being indexed by GloBI . Over 100k association records across about 18k taxa. Anecdotal evidence suggests that there's much room for improving data extraction from existing records. My hope is that with (minor) tweaks in familiar transcription workflows, we can increase quality and granularity of existing and newly acquired association data.\r\n\r\nFor a glimpse of indexed SCAN data, see www.globalbioticinteractions.org/?accordingTo=globi%3Aglobalbioticinteractions%2Fscan (entire collection), www.globalbioticinteractions.org/?accordingTo=globi%3Aglobalbioticinteractions%2Fscan (individual record) and attached screenshots.\r\n\r\nI am curious to see how this first integration with scan/symbiota will evolve into linkage of records that benefit researchers.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2019-09-25 09-00-53](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1084872/65618384-0c2cb380-df73-11e9-81c6-9e504b9899b7.png)\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2019-09-25 09-08-02](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1084872/65618932-0e434200-df74-11e9-8b31-1747bbd9aa88.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/535096383/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/535099895","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/357#issuecomment-535099895","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/357","id":535099895,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNTA5OTg5NQ==","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-25T16:19:33Z","updated_at":"2019-09-25T16:27:47Z","body":"btw - please note that the GloBI's taxon graph is still updating, so some of the newly introduced records might not show up in an explicit taxon query yet.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/535099895/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/535128157","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/357#issuecomment-535128157","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/357","id":535128157,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNTEyODE1Nw==","user":{"login":"neilcobb","id":5989674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5ODk2NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5989674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcobb","html_url":"https://github.com/neilcobb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcobb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcobb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcobb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcobb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcobb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcobb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcobb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcobb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcobb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-25T17:30:15Z","updated_at":"2019-09-25T17:30:15Z","body":"Thanks and I am taking all of this in but may not be able to really get engaged until next week at the Summit meeting.
