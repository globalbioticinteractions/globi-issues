For this dataset, all arctos datasets are included and records reference are resolved and taxonomic information is integrated. \r\n\r\nIn short, the unresolved specimen records are a known issue and am hoping to find a good solution for this beyond the existing way as used in https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/vertnet . See e.g., discussions in #616 and #602  .\r\n\r\n@arw36 how would you prefer to define the dependencies of one dataset (e.g., Arctos Parasites) to another (Arctos hosts) so that references can be more easily resolved?\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/831509111/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/831513963","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/659#issuecomment-831513963","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/659","id":831513963,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgzMTUxMzk2Mw==","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-03T20:29:14Z","updated_at":"2021-05-03T20:29:14Z","body":"see also https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globi-taxon-names/issues/7 and https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/msb-para/issues/1","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/831513963/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/845358638","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/659#issuecomment-845358638","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/659","id":845358638,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg0NTM1ODYzOA==","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-20T18:21:25Z","updated_at":"2021-05-20T18:21:25Z","body":"After changes made via https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/msb-para/commit/a60e2670eebe109893d1d9f336aa4203fc80cf63 , most MSB Para related interaction records are resolved so that to their scientific names can be shown.
