As data continues to be gathered I had another idea. Is there a way to make the connector line thicker or otherwise different to indicate when there are more connections? For instance in the example of red oak (http://www.globalbioticinteractions.org/browse/#interactionType=interactsWith&resultType=json&targetTaxon=&sourceTaxon=Quercus%20rubra), perhaps red oak has 50 examples of interaction with white oak and only 10 with white ash. Perhaps the line linking to white oak could be thicker, or a different color. Also the type of connection could influence the symbiology.\n\nMaybe it's a pain or impossible to program but just a thought\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/233/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/233/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
