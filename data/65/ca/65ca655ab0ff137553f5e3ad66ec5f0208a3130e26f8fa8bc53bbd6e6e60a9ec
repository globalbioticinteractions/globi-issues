How does the review help you better understand GloBI's interpretation\r\nthe Schwarz 2021 dataset?\r\nIt did help understand how the records will show up in GloBI. The review\r\nalso made me realize that there's a bunch of \"species\" in this dataset that\r\nare not identified at all (e.g., animal99). Is it possible to remove those\r\nrecords from GloBI?\r\n\r\n3. What would you add to the tables / figures to help a reviewer like\r\nyourself get a quick sense of the quality of the dataset, the taxonomic\r\nscope of the data, etc.?\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to have tables or figures showing the geographic scope of\r\nthe dataset. I.e., how many sites sampled and over what scale? I think this\r\ndataset is unique because it aggregates 30 or so other datasets and it\r\nwould be nice to have that come through more clearly in the report, if\r\npossible. As I mentioned above there are also a bunch of interactions\r\nbetween things like 'animal123' and plant99.
