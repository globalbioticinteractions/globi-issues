From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsporidia (accessed at 11 April 2017):\r\n\r\n```\r\n[...] They were once considered protozoans or protists, but are now known to be fungi,[6] or a sister group to fungi.[7] [...]\r\n```\r\nSo, it appears that the conflict you found is has been a topic of debate in recent history. It appears that EOL, Index Fungorum, NCBI taxonomy (and more) are using the Fungi kingdom, whereas GBIF and ITIS are *not* using the Fungi kingdom for this genus. So, the behavior is as expected and ... confusing.\r\n\r\n![screenshot from 2017-04-11 09-34-48](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1084872/24919936/2bf8a986-1e9a-11e7-98f3-f05d3da98960.png)\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/293317697/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/293320434","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/289#issuecomment-293320434","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/289","id":293320434,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5MzMyMDQzNA==","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-11T16:34:05Z","updated_at":"2017-04-11T16:34:05Z","body":"Re: species _Bodo saltans_ \r\n\r\nIt appear that Protozoa is a kind of Protista (see http://eol.org/info/456).
