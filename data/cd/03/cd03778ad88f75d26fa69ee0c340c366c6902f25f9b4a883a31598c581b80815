Still have to add the taxon ids and taxon path, so that its easy to retrieve images and other info like common names from other apis like http://eol.org/api .  I figured that a query style might be nicer than dumping > 40MB of json into a file ;) with the additional advantage of being able to query for specific interactions, taxa and locations. Let me know if you'd prefer the huge json file regardless. . . \n\nCurious to hear your thoughts . . . and let me know if you have any ideas on how to visualize or otherwise use GloBI interaction data . . .\n\nthx,\n-jorrit\n\nSome examples:\n\nShows all observations of predators of brown shrimp _(Farfantepenaeus aztecus)_ in Gulf of Mexico (area bounded by north-west lat/lng 29.3/-97.0 and south-east lat/lng 26.3/96.1):\nhttp://trophicgraph.com:8080/taxon/Farfantepenaeus%20aztecus/preyedUponBy?nw_lat=29.3&nw_lng=-97.0&se_lat=26.3&se_lng=96.1&includeObservations=true&type=json.v2\n\nShow all observations of humans _(Homo sapiens)_ preying haddock _(Melanogrammus aeglefinus)_:  \nhttp://trophicgraph.com:8080/taxon/Homo%20sapiens/preysOn/Melanogrammus%20aeglefinus?includeObservations=true&type=json.v2\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/21505886/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
