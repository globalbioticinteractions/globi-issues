It is a mixture of design, ecology, and anthropology - we were introduced to GLOBI via our ecology tutor.\r\n\r\nI'm interested in visualising species richness, initial experiments have focused on seagrass (see attached image visualised in Neo4j), but I'm interested in connecting agricultural and coastal ecosystems.\r\n\r\nI was initially looking to explore the entire GLOBI dataset through the Linkurious platform (this was used in the visualisation of the Panama Papers leak), but I was unable to migrate through the versions to a supported Neo4J version.
