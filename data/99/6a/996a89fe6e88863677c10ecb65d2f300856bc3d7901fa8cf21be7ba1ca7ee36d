About the license of the GloBI dataset (about interaction.tsv.gz).\r\nIs it correct that the data is licensed under CC BY 4.0 as stated on Github?\r\n[https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions__;!!JmoZiZGBv3RvKRSx!szLp8zAbwAC7gjBUtfjk4F3TRvt8C7V9HxQXRZChPK690Trn11pmEWJLEnEe6tFn0gw$)\r\n\r\nIf the dataset is licensed by CC BY 4.0, we are planning to publish the elements below and add the betweenness centrality, page rank.\r\n```\r\nSourceTaxonName\r\nSourceTaxonRank\r\nSourceTaxonSpeciesName\r\nSourceTaxonGenusName\r\nSourceTaxonFamilyName\r\nSourceTaxonOrderName\r\nSourceTaxonClassName\r\nSourceTaxonPhylumName\r\nSourceTaxonKingdomName\r\nTargetTaxonName\r\nTargetTaxonRank\r\nTargetTaxonSpeciesName\r\nTargetTaxonGenusName\r\nTargetTaxonFamilyName\r\nTargetTaxonOrderName\r\nTargetTaxonClassName\r\nTargetTaxonPhylumName\r\nTargetTaxonKingdomName\r\nreferenceCitation\r\nreferenceDoi\r\nreferenceUrl\r\nsourceCitation\r\nsourceNamespace\r\nsourceArchiveURI\r\nsourceDOI\r\n```\r\nAnd, we'll add citation for GloBI on web page that explain how to use web API.\r\n\r\n2. If anyone cites the result of WebAPI that we'll publish, do we need to take any action other than a citation for GloBI?\r\n\r\nRegards.","closed_by":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/772/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/772/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
