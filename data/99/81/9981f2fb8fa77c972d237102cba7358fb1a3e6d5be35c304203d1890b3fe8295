However, the nature of the relation between the specific taxon and the environment terms is not documented. This means that an association of a term \"marine\" to species X might mean: species X has been recorded in a marine environment, but might also indicate that species X is known to _not_ live in a marine environment. Only if the nature of the association of the taxon - environment terms is known, we can search taxa by environment. Closing this issue until this information is available. \n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/70536652/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
