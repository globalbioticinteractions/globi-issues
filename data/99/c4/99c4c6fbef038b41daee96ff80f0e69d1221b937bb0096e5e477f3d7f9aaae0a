I remember hearing that they contacted us. I think it was a special project on their end. Hand-picked slices of things like mammal size, processed almost manually and connections severed, as far as I could tell. A couple of recent google samples suggest they're not using much of it any more. This was about eight years ago; one hopes it was an early experiment and their methods are very different now.\r\n\r\nI don't know if this is relevant, but we definitely had to provide them with an updated sitemap following a major taxonomic update about six years ago. We preserved the taxon IDs as best we could at the time, but we weren't able to keep them all. There was some talk that perhaps google would re-crawl and update, but after a few months they clearly hadn't, (there were google search results to nonexistent EOL pages) and we concluded we'd best do it ourselves. I wasn't in on the sitemap design, but I think we provided the usual/basic/default stuff. It's organized in (I think) a sitemap index; anyway, it lists a bunch of sitemap files, which appear to provide all the urls in the EOL website, with little else that I can read apart from language codes. It's at https://eol.org/data/sitemap/sitemap.xml.gz . I doubt that's directly relevant to GloBI, but what do I know? Maybe there's an analogous approach for data organized in something other than html pages.","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/1997523235/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/1997566541","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/967#issuecomment-1997566541","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/967","id":1997566541,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACXQt853EHJN","user":{"login":"jhammock","id":3026567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMjY1Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3026567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhammock","html_url":"https://github.com/jhammock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhammock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhammock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhammock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhammock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhammock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhammock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhammock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhammock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhammock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-14T14:18:09Z","updated_at":"2024-03-14T14:18:09Z","body":"Oh, I almost forgot.

EOL has done nothing deliberately to facilitate. Different species give different results and I haven't experimented much, but I'll bet if you try some obscure/neglected species you'll see a variety of databases represented in various ways.\r\n\r\nThe first EOL entry is straightforward enough. We generated that text from our structured data, but it was probably scraped from the html; I checked on it a few times and it included some accidental source text for a few days. Why it's a \"featured snippet\", I don't know. EOL text entries aren't always, even when they appear at the top of the results. You'll notice WoRMS is included twice, with the same taxon ID but, I guess, different search settings. GBIF appears twice with different taxon IDs. iNaturalist appears at least twice, same ID, different languages. \r\n\r\nThe second EOL entry is quite interesting. I had to burrow through source code to find the text they selected. If you want to see it, go to https://eol.org/pages/4293114/data (same taxon ID as the first result, different tab), and select \"drag powered swimming\" from the third record down. \r\n\r\nOverall, I imagine... natural language processing, cruising through our nicely structured databases looking for friendly narrative text?\r\n","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/1997566541/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/1997678022","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/967#issuecomment-1997678022","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/967","id":1997678022,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACXQt853EiXG","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-14T15:07:57Z","updated_at":"2024-03-14T15:07:57Z","body":"@jhammock thanks for sharing your experience.
