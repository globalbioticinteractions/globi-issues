Use standard terms across GLOBI interfaces and provide static dictionary. Currently GLOBI divides contributions as \r\nin the _GLOBI website menu_ :\r\n- \"references\" - citation provided at the interaction level. \r\n- \"sources\", sometimes also referred to as \"dataset\" - citation provided to a compiled interaction dataset\r\n\r\nin _GLOBI website text_ \r\n- \"sources\" is sometimes referred to as \"data sources\"\r\n- \"dataset citation\" is sometimes referred to as \"data contributors\", also listed as \"Provider\" in output \r\n\r\nin _API_ locations \r\n- [\"studies\"](https://api.globalbioticinteractions.org/reports/studies) datasets of a particular data source. This definition is confusing. \r\n- [\"sources\"](https://api.globalbioticinteractions.org/reports/sources) lists the sources that contributed datasets to GloBI\r\n\r\nin _rglobi_ (definitions provided by get_data_fields): \r\n- \"study\" - \"Citation associated with the recorded interaction claim\". Of note \"claim\" is used throughout the vignette interchangeably with \"study\" \r\n- \"study source\" - \"Citation associated with the datasets containing the recorded interaction claim\" \r\n\r\nin template files \r\n- \"reference\" - citation provided at the interaction level documented by three columns: . In the ReadMe, simply defined as \"human readable reference\" or \"some resolvable url that point to information related to species interaction record information related to species interaction record\" \r\n-  \"citation\" - located in the globi.json with no guidance other than \"a machine readable description\"\r\n\r\nNone of these terms define any expectations of the claim (e.g., a primary vs. secondary observation). Since many interactions in GLOBI are not provided through academic sources, I think \"study\" should be replaced. I think an ethos of globi is to maintain the provenance of source data, yet there is no enforcement or guidance on how to maintain that provenance. \r\n\r\n- [ ] 2. Would be helpful to clarify how to contribute as a primary observer vs. aggregator vs. transcriber. Right now the contribute page these roles are all lumped together. \r\nhttps://www.globalbioticinteractions.org/contribute#join-a-discussion\r\n\r\n- [ ] 3. Many of GLOBI datasets are sparse. There is ample opportunity for folks to contribute by providing additional fields to existing datasets such as providing taxonomic expertise via TaxonIds for datasets that do not include. Would be nice for GLOBI to layout how to contribute in this way. \r\n-\r\n- [ ] 4. GLOBI flags \"dataset stats\" of [sources](https://www.globalbioticinteractions.org/sources). These should be explained beyond the hover text, with definitions. Perhaps on the [Dataset Management](https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/wiki/Dataset-Management) page? I also they could go further. Some suggested fields: # of distinct interaction types, # of distinct references). Could you choose which taxonomy to match to?
