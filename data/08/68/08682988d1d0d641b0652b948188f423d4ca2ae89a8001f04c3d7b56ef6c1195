I've tried different approaches to use the data but eventually went with the whole interactions.csv file and I have been busy with inspecting and pre-processing all the data. I wanted to ask if you can help me with something. As all the different taxa and taxonomic levels have different Id's (either EOL, GBIF, INIT etc.) I am struggling with finding one unique id for every different taxa along with their taxonomic levels (orderId, familyId, genusId). I have looked carefully at nomer but I can not see how I can use this with a big datafile, I'm missing some explanation on this. The datafile I have left is about 8GB. I am going to make a regression like model so I need all the same taxa to have the same identifier. If I'd use the Id that is given in the Globi file, the same species could have an EOL id in one interaction and a GBIF id in another. When I would analyse the interactions then, they would not be seen as the same species. My best try now was to only keep rows that have an GBIF id in their 'sourceTaxonIds'/'targetTaxonIds' column and use that GBIF id as their unique Id. The problem then remains that the orderId, familyId, genusId etc. also have different Ids for the same family/order/genus and that I lose some data.\r\nMy goal is to have\r\n\r\nA file that contains: sourcetaxonId, interaction, targettaxonId.\r\nA file that contains:\r\n1. taxonId, orderId\r\n2. taxonId, familyId\r\n3. taxonId, genusId\r\nI hope you can help me with this! :)\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nBarbara Meulenbelt","closed_by":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/826/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/826/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
