In this all individual occurrence details are lost. However, I did include a non-aggregated bunch of data next to the aggregates, so if the ingestion takes in the non-aggregated data, you should have access to occurrence measurements.  \n\nThat said, here's my responses to your request for information:\n\n`A bibliographic reference for the study whence the data originally came`\nI've added the reference to ADW that you suggested.  Others should be available, like those on our proof-of-concept page http://eol-globi.github.io\n`A \"compiler\" which is the metastudy where I got the info (ADW is an example of a compiler -- EOL can handle this attribution role if GLoBI can)`\nThis is included in the \"http://purl.org/dc/terms/source\" element in the associations table. In our case SPIRE would be a compiler that includes ADW . . . \n`A year that the data were collected (or published, I'm not totally sure)` \nNot using publication year yet, but should be easy to add.  Question is: most data has collected dates, as well as publication date.  The only inference I can make on the collection dates is that the date is before publication date. Is there another way to recover the actual collection date from the data set?\n`A country (they all have at least this)`\n`A state (where relevant)`\n`A locality (where known)`\nItems country, state and locality are not yet captured, because the initial focus lied on getting lat/lng pairs for each interactions.  When available these are available in the occurrence parts of the darwin core archive.  It should be easy enough to add country, state and locality as a attributes in either measurementOrFact or the occurrence section.\n\n`A habitat (from a controlled vocabulary -- see the panel on the left side of http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/biodiversity/images/ecoLens.png)`\nHabitats are mapped into EnvO (http://environmentontology.org/) are are not yet included in the export.  I am hoping to add these soon!\n\nI'll keep you updated on the items you raised in this issue.

If I understand you right, we have one problem which I should have anticipated. When you create the aggregate dataset for EOL's use, it merges any records from a single provider dataset which join the same two partner taxa, correct? And this requires you to discard all the metadata which might not match between those records. Of course this is why the SPIRE references are missing! If this is the case, here are a couple of fantasy solutions for the aggregate algorythm:\n\nProvider datasets get flagged either Aggregate or Do Not Aggregate and are incorporated accordingly- some have their records collapsed, and others, (just SPIRE so far, possibly) retain all their individual records, and metadata. All the results are thrown together into the aggregated DwC-A.\n\n\"Records to not aggregate\" are automatically detected by the presence of something in the ReferenceID field. These are the only types of records I can think of which should not be collapsed.\n\nIs either of these practical? \n","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/29915307/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/29916986","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/28#issuecomment-29916986","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/28","id":29916986,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5OTE2OTg2","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-12-05T17:14:47Z","updated_at":"2013-12-05T17:14:47Z","body":"Right now, there's two datasets created: aggregated by source (e.g. SPIRE) and non-aggregated.

Cyndy, GoMexSI is not the hugest unaggregated dataset in GloBI, but it averages about 10 records (each with a different reference) per association, so separating them out and giving them back their references would multiply that chunk of the dataset from ~5000 to ~50000, and increase the \"aggregated\" GloBI dataset we ingest by about 50%.
