Second, GloBI index builder didn't previously use the cached inaturalist taxonomies.\r\n\r\nFor now, GloBI index builder *is* using the cached inaturalist taxa, which removes the need to re-resolve 1000s of iNaturalist taxa every couple of days. By using the cached taxa, any changes in the taxonomy itself (name changes, taxon merges) will not be updated until the taxa are re-resolved from scratch. \r\n\r\nWill close issue after confirming that a newer GloBI index has incorporated the cached taxa as expected.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/359093701/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/359104553","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/333#issuecomment-359104553","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/333","id":359104553,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1OTEwNDU1Mw==","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-19T22:15:31Z","updated_at":"2018-01-19T22:15:31Z","body":"Note that the recent failure of https://travis-ci.org/ropensci/rglobi is a direct result of this issue - most human food related interactions come from iNaturalist.
