If I understand it correctly, the EOL team is working on providing an API that makes it workable to resolve the EOL URLs. My workaround using `backwarden` is a bit crazy (i.e. scrape individual jsonld pages for each taxon that might have GloBI data on it), take a ton of time to complete and produce URLs that are stable until a new GloBI refresh occurs. The refresh schedule is set to monthly and there's currently not a way for me to know exactly when it occurs.

I am hoping the GloBI can remain as neutral as possible while allowing users to apply filters to remove (or detect!) suspect interactions.\n\nPerhaps another way to go about this it to introduce quality grades for observation fields (e.g. a research grade \"host\" interaction).\n\nintraspecific inaturalist observations accessed on/around 17 Apr 2015 :\n\n|  | intraspecific inaturalist observations |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1 | Anita. 2005.
