'Denisova'``` NCBI:txid741158 as well as ```Homo sapiens``` NCBI:txid9606 . Note that the interactions.tsv.gz contains a list of taxonIds that includes these and other related taxon identifiers relevant to the source/target taxa.\r\n\r\nAt close inspection it appears that the link was introduced via a taxon name resolver (see previously reported issue https://github.com/GlobalNamesArchitecture/gni/issues/48 fyi @dimus ).\r\n\r\nAs it seems that the resolver service appears to not take action on this as of today for stated reasons (e.g., NCBI is not using proper naming conventions),  we'll have to figure out some other strategy from preventing NCBI subspecies (or virus strains) matches from globalnames from populating taxon links in GloBI.\r\n\r\nHoping to work on this soon. \r\n\r\nThanks again for reporting this important issue and let me know if you have any ideas/ comments/ questions.\r\n\r\nJust for completeness, I've added search results obtained via https://resolver.globalnames.org on 2020-12-07 as screenshots below:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2020-12-07 07-39-25](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1084872/101371317-758aa080-385f-11eb-880a-653d7f86f0d1.png)\r\n![Screenshot from 2020-12-07 07-39-46](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1084872/101371312-74597380-385f-11eb-860a-d63374d8147c.png)\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/739994383/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/740007777","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/569#issuecomment-740007777","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/569","id":740007777,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0MDAwNzc3Nw==","user":{"login":"dimus","id":12124,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12124?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimus","html_url":"https://github.com/dimus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-07T15:57:29Z","updated_at":"2020-12-07T15:57:29Z","body":"@pwrose yes, sorry about that.

I would say you can start use it \"carefully\" and let me know if something breaks, or behaves wrongly.\r\n\r\nCurrently system has 3 moving parts: gnmatcher, gnames, gnverify. After I make 'official' release of gnames (verify.globalnames.org) I am going to make an option of embedding gnmatcher inside of gnames. So you still have to run a gnames service on your machine, but that would make the system independent of networking.\r\n\r\ngithub.com/gnames/gnmatcher can be pretty much standalone now, but need to generate its lookup files first time it runs. gnames still depends on database, and I think to leave it like this because it allows better flexibility with features. When features are stable I suspect gnames also can be moved to key-value stores like gnmatcher. With database I do have a bit of a problem, it does require to use collation C or C.UTF-8, which is not very user-friendly.

To me, this inspires confidence in your ability to create stable services and software programs.\r\n\r\nI think there's great benefit to stable services and software programs. For instance, I am enjoying a Unix program called ```cat``` pretty much daily, and ```cat``` has been around for almost 50 years ( source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_%28Unix%29 accessed at 2021-01-14 ). I wonder whether they ever considered to retire ```cat``` simply because it was too old ; )\r\n\r\nI do have to say that software maintenance is an important and laborious task that is most commonly overlooked or excluded in plans/proposals when new services or software libraries are first introduced. Also, the task software maintenance is often taken for granted by those who use the services: many \"users\" don't see the significant amount of work it takes to keep a service up and running, respond to bug reports, and implement fixes.  \r\n\r\nSo, I can empathize with your desire to stop maintaining current systems and focus on your latest greatest project that includes many of the knowledge you've gained over the last decade. As I am typing this, I am also reflecting on my own practices in developing and maintaining software and I estimate that most of my time is spent on maintaining software and services, this issue (https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/569) being a good example of the amount of time and effort it takes to address a seemingly small issue in linking NCBI taxa to the name 'Homo sapiens'.\r\n\r\nOn a related note: I am actively working on introducing a workaround for this and other NCBI / resolver.globalnames.org name matching challenges and hoping to introduce some fixes sooner rather than later.\r\n\r\nThanks for being patient and for sharing your thoughts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/760282844/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/760311407","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/569#issuecomment-760311407","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/569","id":760311407,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2MDMxMTQwNw==","user":{"login":"dimus","id":12124,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12124?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimus","html_url":"https://github.com/dimus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-14T16:34:26Z","updated_at":"2021-01-14T16:46:38Z","body":"There is also 'fmt' that on all 'normal' Linux distros still is not aware about UTF-8 existence ;)\r\nI recall busybox fixed it for their implementation though","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/760311407/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/760318458","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/569#issuecomment-760318458","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/569","id":760318458,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2MDMxODQ1OA==","user":{"login":"dimus","id":12124,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12124?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimus","html_url":"https://github.com/dimus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-14T16:45:39Z","updated_at":"2021-01-14T16:45:39Z","body":"I stopped investing time into `gni` and `resolver` because both of them lack a crucial feature for me: speed.
