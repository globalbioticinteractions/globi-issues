On our wiki (https://github.com/jhpoelen/eol-globi-data/wiki/Taxonomy-Matching#list-of-resources) a link exists to a report that contains a list of corrections.  If necessary we can extend the information provided in these reports. Bottom line: the taxon name correction is automated, traceable and reproducible so that we can understand why a name is used.  Also, it helps us to go back and apply corrections if necessary.   \n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/31029828/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
