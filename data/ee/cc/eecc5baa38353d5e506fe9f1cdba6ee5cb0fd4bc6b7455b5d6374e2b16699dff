This taxonomic literature often contains information about how species interact. Example: \r\n\r\nGUGLIELMONE, A.A., PETNEY, T.N. & ROBBINS, R.G., 2020. Ixodidae (Acari: Ixodoidea): descriptions and redescriptions of all known species from 1758 to December 31, 2019. Zootaxa, 4871(1), pp.1–322. Available at: https://doi.org/10.11646/zootaxa.4871.1.1.   See attached image for sample text. \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1084872/98750249-4f620580-2372-11eb-8ffa-dd5262cdc9e3.png)\r\n\r\nVarious folks already expressed an interest in helping to index the species interactions in his publication.\r\n\r\nIdea:\r\n\r\nOutline a workflow that helps:\r\n\r\n1. identify taxonomic publications of interest (e.g., all taxonomic literature of tick ( Ixodidae ) ) (Plazi)\r\n2. provide OCR-ed text + original (Plazi)\r\n3. manually, semi-automatically, or automatically extract species interaction (facilitated by GloBI community / tools? / Note for Nature or other platform?)\r\n4. publish versions of the transcribed data with clear provenance (Plazi<>GloBI)\r\n5. annotate extracted (host of) interaction using the Zenodo annotations (#488 )\r\n\r\n@mguidoti @myrmoteras @seltmann - I am hoping to re-use the experience we gained during https://globalbioticinteractions.org/plazi-zenodo to help prototype a workflow with existing tools.
