At this point, I can image three use cases: transcription mistake, outdated name, not-sure-that-this-is name.  How about something like:\n\n**transcription mistake**\n1. student makes mistake in transcribing a name \"Avez\"\n2. GloBI cannot find match for \"Avez\" \n3. avian diet database curator requests / received name report from GloBI\n4. student/ curator review the name \"Avez\" and checks against data source\n5. the data source mentions \"Aves\" instead of \"Avez\" \n6. the occurrences including \"Avez\" are corrected in the data source (e.g. AvianDietDatabase.txt)\n\n**outdated names**\nData source contains a name that is no longer used _and_ this outdated name is not available through (meta-) taxonomic services such as ITIS or EOL. \n1. name is transcribed correctly by student\n2. GloBI can't find a match \n3. after review of name list, the student double checks that the name is same as in source\n4. the current name for the taxon is determined and added to a specific taxon correction list (perhaps something like, or actually re-using, the GloBI general [taxon correction list](https://github.com/jhpoelen/eol-globi-data/wiki/Taxonomy-Matching#submitting-name-corrections)). The correction is described as \"outdated name\" or similar using a controlled vocabulary of naming terms. \n5. student submits the outdated name to a naming authority (e.g. ITIS) and suggests to add the name to the list of previously valid names, \n\n**not-sure-what-this-is name**\nSimilar to the outdated name. Only for this unknown taxon name the correction code is something like \"undetermined\" or \"unknown\" and no suggestion is provided. Alternatively, a higher order taxon can be provided to provide some information about the taxon (if available). When GloBI provides a name report, the reason of the correction (or non-correction) is provided so that the student / curator can easily exclude \"undetermined\" or \"unknown\" names.\n\nIn short - fix the transcriptions errors (e.g. typos) in the source and introduce a way to annotate and correct outdated taxon names using a dedicated taxon correction list. \n\nIdeally the avian diet database (or any other data source) should be publishable (e.g. data paper in esa pubs) by itself without having the rely on GloBI. GloBI is just a way to integrate, link and access this rich source of information into a larger body of interaction datasets: software comes and goes, but data is forever.\n\nI'd be willing to discuss more over phone / skype if necessary (or organize a workshop?). In my mind, data peer review and access methods (which what I believe this is) can be super useful but might take some back and forth to figure out the most efficient way to implement them. Curious to hear your thoughts.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/96726142/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/97067589","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/132#issuecomment-97067589","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/132","id":97067589,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk3MDY3NTg5","user":{"login":"dimus","id":12124,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12124?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimus","html_url":"https://github.com/dimus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-28T13:39:17Z","updated_at":"2015-04-28T14:36:53Z","body":"Hi Jorrit, I am available today in the second half of the day, and about\nany time tomorrow.

Hey Allen - I've prepared a new version of the taxon name report for you using the Prey_Name_Status data that you provide: you can find the current list of unmatched or suspicious name order by state by following http://tinyurl.com/hurlbertTaxonNameReportV4 and clicking on the looking glass (i.e. execute) button.  \n\nI've attached the result that came out. Note that the name status is treated as a controlled vocabulary term. In this case it would be the \"Hurlbert Name Status\" vocabulary. I suspect that we'll figure out a mapping to other name status vocabs at some point.\n\nLet me know if this name report will help you manage your names better.
