This is why I am considering a *streaming query* approach to select suitable triples/quads from the OpenBiodiv knowledge graph. As we found out by the difficulties in getting all the data out of GraphDB, I realized that a sparql endpoint is computationally expensive and would be hard for GloBI to maintain or integrate with.  \r\n\r\nOne such lightweight integration method can be imagined around combining linked data fragments and streaming queries . Ruben Verborgh @rubenverborgh  and collaborators have worked a bunch to develop the idea of linked data fragments https://linkeddatafragments.org . The idea of streaming queries is making an entry into the \"big data\" world via compute frameworks like https://spark.apache.org/streaming/ .\r\n\r\nA simple implementation I imagine is:\r\n\r\n1. define the required triple pattern in terms of triple/quad selectors (see https://linkeddatafragments.org/concept/) \r\n2. define some statement window to define a range in which the selectors should be applied\r\n2. stream all nquads through the selectors, generating results whenever all selectors match.\r\n\r\nOne way to conceptualize this is to think of this as a sparql query that is applied to a rolling window across all statements. \r\n\r\nNeedless to say, I am trying to figure out a first minimal implementation of this way to extract species association related triples from the wealth of knowledge that you expose through the OpenBiodiv graph.\r\n\r\nAm curious to hear your thoughts on this. Also, I am curious to hear whether you have examples of full OpenBiodiv graph integrations like the one we are pursuing.
