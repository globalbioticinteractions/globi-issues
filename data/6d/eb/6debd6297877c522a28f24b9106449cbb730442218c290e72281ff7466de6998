You can find the list [here](https://github.com/jhpoelen/foragus/blob/master/src/test/resources/name-test.csv). I've added you as a collaborator to the github repo, so you should be able to edit the file directly in the github web interface. \n\nAnother thing I made is a test for the title and description generation. Using common name, scientific name (taxon name) and interaction type, I was able to generate:\n\n``` json\n{\"title\": \"True Seal Food\",\n\"description\": \"what do true seals eat?\nwhat do phocids eat?\nwhat do true seals prey on?\nwhat do phocids prey on?\nwhat do true seals hunt?\nwhat do phocids hunt?\ntrue seal prey\nphocid prey\ntrue seal food\nphocid food\"}\n```\n\nSome questions to help me move forward:\n1. please let me know if you are able to edit the list of expect \"commonized\" names and whether it makes sense to have you extend the list to include most common cases.\n2. does the title and description generation for Phocidae make sense?

A\nlittle hard. ...But not too bad. Second, Dima tells me SSL shouldn't be\nhard to add once we move the servers (about a month from now). We don't\nneed to wait for that, but I thought I'd mention it. Yay!\n\nThe bad (kinda) news is: it won't be using the old API. At all. Good\nriddance (well, the old API will be _around,_ but deprecated). It will be\nusing a much more \"Railsy\" interface. So the params will be a little\ndifferent.\n\nI haven't ironed out what a write will look like, but there are a few\nthings I can tell you in advance:\n\nA) Because I want to keep the old API around, I have to give this a new\nname. So, for now, it's \"wapi\" (for \"write API\"). ...A little silly, but\nmemorable, at least. :\\\nB) You'll want to pass the version of the API (wapi?) you're using in the\nheaders, using something like \"Accept: application/vnd.eol_wapi.v1\" (for\nversion 1 of the API). This will keep things stable, so I can work on new\nfeatures without breaking your code.\nC) You'll need to pass your user's api_key in the header as well, with the\n\"Authorization\" key, and it's encrypted. I'm not sure what this looks like\nin PHP, but in Rails, this looks something like this (YMMV):\n\nget 'http://eol.org/wapi/collections', {}, { \"HTTP_AUTHORIZATION\" =>\nHttpAuthentication::Token.encode_credentials(\"1234123\") }\n\nIt's a little more elegant (if redundant) with curl:\n\ncurl http://eol.org/wapi/collections -H 'Authorization: Token\ntoken=\"1234123\"'\n\nErrr... please note neither of these actually work today, since I'm\nactually using a local URI, not eol.org. I'm just showing what it might\nlook like. :\\\n\n...We will (eventually) set up a testing environment to make sure this\nworks.\nD) Again, I haven't finished this, but the params will look more like a\ntypical Rails API, so the params will probably be _something_\\* like this\n(pretending it's JSON for clarity):\n\ncollection:{name:\"Something cool\",description:\"lots of important stuff\nhere\",collection_items:[{\"annotation\":\"Something\ninteresting\",\"collected_item_id\":75,\"collected_item_type\":\"TaxonConcept\",\"sort_field\":\"12\"}]\n}\n\nMore info as I have it; sorry for the delay / thanks for being patient!\n- Like I said, I still need time to iron this out...\n\nOn Thu, Jan 22, 2015 at 3:07 PM, Jeremy Rice jrice.blue@gmail.com wrote:\n\n> Yes... if you give me a few days to think about it and work on it!  :D\n> \n> (BTW: Good stuff!

This is  a little tool that queries (or forages) GloBI and builds eol collections from a list of provided popular eol page ids.\n\nCurrently, the collections are generated whenever a file [popular_eol_page_ids.csv](https://github.com/jhpoelen/foragus/blob/master/src/test/resources/popular_eol_page_ids.csv) is updated. The resulting collection json files are published to s3 (until eol write api is available). To access these json files, go to https://travis-ci.org/jhpoelen/foragus and scoll down the log window. Here you should see stuff like:\n\n```\nINFO: uploading: /home/travis/build/jhpoelen/foragus/target/34543.json (size: 3.9KB)\ndownload_url: https://globi-travis.s3.amazonaws.com/jhpoelen/foragus/24/24.1/target/34543.json\n\nINFO: uploading: /home/travis/build/jhpoelen/foragus/target/7666.json (size: 131KB)\ndownload_url: https://globi-travis.s3.amazonaws.com/jhpoelen/foragus/24/24.1/target/7666.json\n\nDone uploading artifacts\n```\n\nNot quite as user friendly as EOL collection pages, but it would allow you to play around with the different page ids: add / remove page ids from  [popular_eol_page_ids.csv](https://github.com/jhpoelen/foragus/blob/master/src/test/resources/popular_eol_page_ids.csv) by clicking \"edit\"/\"save\" in the GitHub webpages, wait for a couple of minutes and you should see a new batch published on [travis](https://travis-ci.org/jhpoelen/foragus).\n\n@jhammock - do the collection json file contains the name, description that you were hoping to get?\n\n@JRice - is the format of the collection json ok? \n\nPS If this is approach too geeky, please do let me know, and we'll figure out a different way to play around with this gadget.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/73558023/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/73562214","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/80#issuecomment-73562214","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/80","id":73562214,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczNTYyMjE0","user":{"login":"jhammock","id":3026567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMjY1Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3026567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhammock","html_url":"https://github.com/jhammock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhammock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhammock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhammock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhammock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhammock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhammock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhammock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhammock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhammock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-02-09T18:30:19Z","updated_at":"2015-02-09T18:30:19Z","body":"The collection info looks lovely, thanks, Jorrit.

I failed with the fairly awkward tense, \"sea otter eats\"...\n","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/78611308/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/78625978","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/80#issuecomment-78625978","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/80","id":78625978,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4NjI1OTc4","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-12T21:26:38Z","updated_at":"2015-03-12T21:26:38Z","body":"@jhammock thanks for creating the collections. . . manually!

(Hi Jorrit!)\n\nI think having people do the search is a great idea.  You do have to prime them, but I think you can ask them to come up with different phrases to query EOL around the concept of \"what seals eat\".  I think they will have fun with it and people will have different ways of asking that.\n\nFun!\n\nAnd, soon.....no more manual creation of these collections!!\n\nBest,\nMarie\n\n---\n\nMarie Studer Ph.D.\nLearning + Education Director\nEncyclopedia of Life\n\nOffice:  617 496-1560\nMobile:  617 999-3700\n\n> On Mar 12, 2015, at 5:31 PM, Jen Hammock notifications@github.com wrote:\n> \n> There's no keeping up with you, Jorrit...\n> \n> I was thinking as an exercise tomorrow we could show people a picture of a sea otter or seal and ask them to inquire of EOL what this animal eats, to see how many find their way.
