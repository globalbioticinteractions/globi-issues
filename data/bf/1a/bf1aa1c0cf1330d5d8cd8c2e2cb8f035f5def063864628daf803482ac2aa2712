Allowing to run open-ended queries (e.g., Cypher queries) on a public neo4j causes the main GloBI website and API to be at the mercy of whoever happens to run a query.  Also, having folks write queries that run against specific versions of neo4j and/or GloBI schema would provide less room for doing software maintenance (e.g., upgrade neo4j, optimize GloBI schema). \r\n>\r\n> In other words, the neo4j instance that GloBI website / API is using is up and running, but no longer publicly accessible to run queries on it directly. This is also why rglobi > 0.3.x doesn't support running Cypher queries directly anymore (see https://github.com/ropensci/rglobi/releases/tag/v0.3.4) .\r\n> \r\n> However, you run your own instance by downloading a neo4j db archive from https://globalbioticinteractions.org/data and run it with a supported neo4j version (currently an \"ancient\" version v3.5.x, but see also  #860 ).\r\n>\r\n> Apologies for the inconvenience, and I hope you understand that GloBI is trying to balance providing easier access to millions of openly available species interaction claims with keeping the overhead/cost of running servers / maintenance down.\r\n\r\n> [...]\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @jhpoelen in https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/987#issuecomment-2127026226_\r\n            ","closed_by":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/988/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/988/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
