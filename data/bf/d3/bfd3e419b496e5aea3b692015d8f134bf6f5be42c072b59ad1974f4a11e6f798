Please bear with me as your observations lift the curtain on complex data integration that happens when GloBI is indexing interaction claims in existing datasets records.\r\n\r\nYour example specimen record http://arctos.database.museum/guid/MSB:Mamm:158132 supports claims of two host-parasite interactions, with parasites being http://arctos.database.museum/guid/MSB:Para:28042 http://arctos.database.museum/guid/MSB:Para:28030 . So, I'd expect two interaction record claims to attributed to http://arctos.database.museum/guid/MSB:Mamm:158132 . \r\n\r\nsee included screenshot of web page provided via http://arctos.database.museum/guid/MSB:Mamm:158132 \r\n![Screenshot from 2021-02-12 15-56-00](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1084872/107835535-acdd6800-6d4e-11eb-8a28-c2d126bde1b7.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition, GloBI currently finds the parasites in MSB via two endpoints: one via the RSS feed of vertnet (i.e. http://ipt.vertnet.org:8080/ipt/rss.do, see https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/vertnet), and one more explicitly via the URL pointing to the MSB Para DwC-A (i.e. http://ipt.vertnet.org:8080/ipt/archive.do?r=msb_para also see https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/msb-para) .  Currently, to preserve provenance, the interaction claims found through both paths (one via Vertnet IPT RSS feed, one via MSB Para DwC-A) are indexed separately. \r\n\r\nI realize that the citation ```https://vertnet.org``` does not capture the full complexity of the myriad of datasets used to compile a specific claim, and an existing issue #557 describes a desire to better capture complex data provenance graphs. In this case, the source citation should probably include Vertnet (providing the IPT RSS feed) and MSB Para (URL to DwC-A) and MSB Host (URL to DwC-A) - GloBI needs to index all three datasets (RSS feed being a dataset also) to find and compile the interaction claims and their related records. Note that the MSB Para DwC-A contains a reference to the MSB Host records in the associatedOccurrences field, leaving GloBI to pull in the MSB Host DwC-A, find the associated record and assemble the interaction claim with taxonomic, location etc. information in addition to the URL to the host record.\r\n\r\nWithout discarding the provenance of the data, what alternate citation format would help you to distinguish the records of interaction claims, their supporting evidence and the way the digital data was found?\r\n\r\nThanks for being patient and am curious to hear your comments / questions / suggestions.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/778526064/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/778527404","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/602#issuecomment-778527404","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/602","id":778527404,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3ODUyNzQwNA==","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-13T00:27:38Z","updated_at":"2021-02-13T00:27:38Z","body":"@Jegelewicz am open to meeting to go through your observations/comments in detail if desired.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/778527404/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/778682684","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/602#issuecomment-778682684","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/602","id":778682684,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3ODY4MjY4NA==","user":{"login":"Jegelewicz","id":5725767,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjU3Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725767?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jegelewicz","html_url":"https://github.com/Jegelewicz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jegelewicz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jegelewicz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jegelewicz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jegelewicz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jegelewicz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jegelewicz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jegelewicz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jegelewicz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jegelewicz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-13T21:47:57Z","updated_at":"2021-02-13T21:47:57Z","body":"> Your example specimen record http://arctos.database.museum/guid/MSB:Mamm:158132 supports claims of two host-parasite interactions,\r\n\r\nApologies for my laziness - I should have checked on that!\r\n\r\n> Without discarding the provenance of the data, what alternate citation format would help you to distinguish the records of interaction claims, their supporting evidence and the way the digital data was found?\r\n\r\n@jhpoelen I'm guessing that Arctos is just weird because although we publish through Vertnet to get data to the aggregators, you are also able to extract directly from Arctos. Mariel should comment, but it seems like a lot of this would be irrelevant if you just used data from one place or the other. I would prefer it come directly from Arctos as it is the actual source data, but that would mean that you would need to somehow exclude Arctos data from anything you take from Vertnet. Dave Bloom at Vertnet should probably comment as well, but the thing about Vertnet is that they are also an aggregator of sorts and anything you take from there is probably also present at GBIF and/or iDigBio and possibly other aggregators as well. From an Arctos perspective, the GloBI study_url is what we would prefer be cited, no matter where someone gets the data, because then we could more easily locate citations in papers and demonstrate the worth of the things that support these interactions.\r\n\r\nAnyway, it might pay to have @campmlc @dbloom and @dustymc chime in and maybe we should all get together for a chat about this.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/778682684/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/779375003","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/602#issuecomment-779375003","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/602","id":779375003,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3OTM3NTAwMw==","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-15T17:55:18Z","updated_at":"2021-02-15T17:55:18Z","body":"I am glad to hear that the Arctos URIs like http://arctos.database.museum/guid/MSB:Mamm:158132 are suited for citations.

Does this matter? Here is why I think it does:\r\n\r\n1. The more supported interactions, the more confidence someone might place in its veracity. Duplication could lead to overconfidence.\r\n2. People will end up citing Arctos records in a variety of ways that will never be discovered by the collections. Some using the Arctos url, some using vertnet, some using SCAN and so on. It is hard enough for collections to track their usage when they loan objects directly, but if citations of their material are not standard, then they will continue to under-report usage and appear less important than they actually are. I'm not sure this is fixable - I would imagine that anyone who uses this data will just cite GloBI...\r\n3. When these citations show up in the literature, will they be repeated and scraped up by GloBI leading to more overconfidence? Just a citation of an interaction doesn't necessarily indicate that anyone confirmed it, just that they used it.\r\n\r\nAs with any aggregation system, I would hope that users of GloBI data would do quite a bit of data cleaning and review before use. GBIF and others are loaded with duplicated specimens and not-very-good data and the nature of GloBI means that it will have some of the same issues. I just want it to be clear what users are getting when they download because in my opinion this data is not fit for use for a lot of the questions that might be asked of it unless someone does a thorough review. Even my simple question: What % of interactions including _Ixodes_ are supported by museum vouchers? Took a day of review, cleaning and an assumption about what citation referred to a voucher and what to an observation. And anyone besides me might never connect the dots about the duplication between Arctos and vertnet, so my voucher numbers would have been overstated and it would look as if there was a lot more support in vouchers for those interactions that there actually is.\r\n\r\nThere really isn't a good solution for some of this because of no.3 above. Eventually ALL of the interactions could be duplicated. We could prevent duplication with Vernet by only publishing Arctos data via Vertnet, but that is something that @campmlc and others would need to decide.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/779410486/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/779424872","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/602#issuecomment-779424872","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/602","id":779424872,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3OTQyNDg3Mg==","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-15T20:03:01Z","updated_at":"2021-02-15T20:03:01Z","body":"@Jegelewicz Thanks for sharing your thoughts. I agree that re-using data to compile a dataset fit for use is a time consuming process, especially when sourced from aggregate search indexes like GBIF and GloBI. Perhaps this highlights the danger of presenting a search index to look like an actively curated collection management system like Arctos. As you know, any added layer of complexity comes with potential sources of bias, translation errors, omissions, duplication etc. This is why I am consistently thinking of ways to make it easier to retrace the steps taken by GloBI to support an interaction claim with evidence. \r\n\r\nThis, and your earlier points, highlight the importance of not just the underlying evidence (e.g., the specimen), but also how, where, and by who this evidence was referenced. This is why I consider the provenance of the data to be so important. Also, I realize that keeping track of these (boring but important) provenance is hard to do manually and better methods are needed to keep track of the digital life history of data. Just like citation managers help scholars to publish papers, specimen citation managers might be able to help keep track of the citation and provenance of the claim.\r\n\r\nTo help inform better ways to improve provenance recording/reporting and citation practices, I was hoping you could help me with some practical points around the data cleaning - \r\n\r\n0. where did you get your GloBI index data from ?\r\n1.

An example of this is an Arctos collection depending on records from iNaturalist (https://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Ento:11240?seid=3670656 points to https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/7132307 )\r\n4. somehow increase awareness of the wide variety of kinds of source datasets (e.g., collection, literature studies, observations) to avoid confusing outcomes\r\n\r\nI am sure I missed a few things, so please feel free to add / update etc.\r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/785476503/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/785478380","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/602#issuecomment-785478380","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/602","id":785478380,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4NTQ3ODM4MA==","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-25T00:11:50Z","updated_at":"2021-02-25T00:11:50Z","body":"for what it is worth - here's some of the scripts I used to summarize the ixodes data:\r\n\r\n```terminal\r\n$ zcat ixodes-20210224.tsv.gz | cut -f80,81 | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr > sources_with_ixodes_by_record_count.txt\r\n$ zcat ixodes-20210224.tsv.gz | grep -i \"Mammalia\" | cut -f80,81 | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr > sources_with_ixodes_by_record_count_mammals_only.txt\r\n```","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/785478380/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/786106865","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/602#issuecomment-786106865","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/602","id":786106865,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4NjEwNjg2NQ==","user":{"login":"Jegelewicz","id":5725767,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjU3Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725767?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jegelewicz","html_url":"https://github.com/Jegelewicz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jegelewicz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jegelewicz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jegelewicz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jegelewicz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jegelewicz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jegelewicz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jegelewicz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jegelewicz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jegelewicz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-25T18:23:41Z","updated_at":"2021-02-25T18:23:41Z","body":"@jhpoelen thanks for the meet-up yesterday.

So, one of the vertnet interaction records is sourced from the host DwC-A and the other is sourced/indexed from the parasite DwC-A . \r\n\r\nre: same DwC-A  indexed multiple times: And the other related issue, a single dwc-a being indexed directly vs. indirectly (e.g., via vertnet) in a work in progress closely related to associated issue in #546 . The core challenge here is the GloBI has to somehow figure out where to pull the information related to a associatedOccurrence reference record . As DwC-A do not provide a way to state where to look for additional information, I had to implement my own method to make this work. And this method can be improved by making the dependencies explicit in globi.json rather than relying on the VertNet RSS feed.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/786119343/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/786120547","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/602#issuecomment-786120547","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/602","id":786120547,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4NjEyMDU0Nw==","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-25T18:45:50Z","updated_at":"2021-02-25T18:46:04Z","body":"@Jegelewicz if you get a chance, I'd be interested to see some examples of the records related to your statement \" ```That seems crazy, but a quick review shows that almost all of these are from the NMNH data and I think that catalog numbers in that data set would help resolve that issue.```\"","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/786120547/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/786123994","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/602#issuecomment-786123994","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/602","id":786123994,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4NjEyMzk5NA==","user":{"login":"campmlc","id":14808196,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODA4MTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14808196?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/campmlc","html_url":"https://github.com/campmlc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/campmlc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/campmlc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/campmlc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/campmlc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/campmlc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/campmlc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/campmlc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/campmlc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/campmlc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-25T18:51:53Z","updated_at":"2021-02-25T18:51:53Z","body":"So if I understand correctly there would be at least four entries for this\nreciprocal relationship?
