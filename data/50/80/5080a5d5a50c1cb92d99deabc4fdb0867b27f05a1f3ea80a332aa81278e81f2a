Also, I found that some of the interaction terms that you are using are not (yet) supported by GloBI, but support can be added sooner rather than later. \r\n\r\n```https://doi-org.myezproxy.vub.ac.be/10.2307/1936252``` is suspected to be ```10.2307/1936252``` or ```doi:10.2307/1936252``` . \r\n\r\nISO8601 Date ranges look like ```1997/1999``` instead of ```1997-1999``` . Please also note the use of month number ```17``` in the date range that includes ```2014-17```. Suspect an unintended excel auto-increment copy/paste .\r\n\r\nAlso, please update the README.md and citation in globi.json to include pointers/citations to your datasets.  \r\n\r\nHope this helps, and let me know if you have any questions.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ bash ~/proj/globi/globinizer/check-dataset.sh AgentschapPlantentuinMeise/ashForestInteractions\r\n   _____ _       ____ _____   _____            _                \r\n  / ____| |     |  _ \\_   _| |  __ \\          (_)               \r\n | |  __| | ___ | |_) || |   | |__) |_____   ___  _____      __ \r\n | | |_ | |/ _ \\|  _ < | |   |  _  // _ \\ \\ / / |/ _ \\ \\ /\\ / / \r\n | |__| | | (_) | |_) || |_  | | \\ \\  __/\\ V /| |  __/\\ V  V /  \r\n  \\_____|_|\\___/|____/_____| |_|  \\_\\___| \\_/ |_|\\___| \\_/\\_/   \r\n | |           |  ____| | |                                     \r\n | |__  _   _  | |__  | | |_ ___  _ __                          \r\n | '_ \\| | | | |  __| | | __/ _ \\| '_ \\                         \r\n | |_) | |_| | | |____| | || (_) | | | |                        \r\n |_.__/ \\__, | |______|_|\\__\\___/|_| |_|                        \r\n         __/ |                                                  \r\n        |___/                                                   \r\nMiller 5.3.0\r\ns3cmd version 2.1.0\r\njava version \"1.8.0_171\"\r\nJava(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_171-b11)\r\nJava HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.171-b11, mixed mode)\r\nusing local elton found at [/usr/local/bin/elton]\r\n\r\nReview of [AgentschapPlantentuinMeise/ashForestInteractions] using Elton version [0.10.7] started at [2021-02-09T11:47:41-08:00].\r\nupdating [AgentschapPlantentuinMeise/ashForestInteractions]... done.\r\ncreating review [AgentschapPlantentuinMeise/ashForestInteractions]... done.\r\nlisting interactions [AgentschapPlantentuinMeise/ashForestInteractions]... done.\r\nlisting nanopubs [AgentschapPlantentuinMeise/ashForestInteractions]... done.\r\n\r\nReview of [AgentschapPlantentuinMeise/ashForestInteractions] included:\r\n  -
