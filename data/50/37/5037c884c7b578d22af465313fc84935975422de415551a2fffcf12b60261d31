However, the search does show the unresolved names. See e.g., _Rhinolophus sinicus_ via https://www.globalbioticinteractions.org/?accordingTo=globi%3Aglobalbioticinteractions%2Fplazi-covid19&interactionType=interactsWith&sourceTaxon=Rhinolophus%20sinicus as reported by your spreadsheet. Many virus names have not yet been linked to a virus hierarchy, so the visualization looks sparser than expected. See #494 . \r\n\r\nSecond, GloBI currently only considers the ```Coronavirus Species``` column. Some of the values in this column are empty, even thought the ```Abbreviation``` column is populated. Which column to use for virus name matching?\r\n\r\nThird, GloBI has some name mappings issues. For instance, ```Rhinolophus sinicus bat CoVs``` is mapped to ```Rhinolophus sinicus```, which make it appear as if ```Rhinolophus sinicus``` is a host of itself. See https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globi-taxon-names/issues/2 .\r\n\r\nSo, thanks to this early integration, we uncovered some silly GloBI bugs and it seems that the we need to have a closer look at naming linking schemes that will work nicely. One way to go about it is to provide taxon ids for bats and their viruses using some appropriate taxonomy. \r\n\r\nfor completeness, here are the unprocessed _Rhinolophus sinicus_ interactions found in the Plazi google sheet by via Elton review\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ elton review | cut -f15 | tail -n+2 | jq --compact-output '{source: .context.sourceTaxonName, target: .context.targetTaxonName,
