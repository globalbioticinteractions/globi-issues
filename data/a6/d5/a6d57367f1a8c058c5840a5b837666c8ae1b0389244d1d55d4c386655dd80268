There are duplicate interactions in GloBI where the same interaction is ingested from MSB and from Vertnet. An example is:\r\n\r\nstudy_citation | study_url | study_source_citation\r\n-- | -- | --\r\nhttp://arctos.database.museum/guid/MSB:Para:26976 | http://arctos.database.museum/guid/MSB:Para:26976 | https://vertnet.org\r\nhttp://arctos.database.museum/guid/MSB:Para:26976 | http://arctos.database.museum/guid/MSB:Para:26976 | The MSB Division of Parasitology Collection\r\n\r\nI was only looking at interactions involving Ixodes, and not ALL of the MSB instances were duplicated at Vertnet (which seems odd...). I am also puzzled by the citation of Vertnet when the source url indicates Arctos. \r\n\r\nI also found one Vertnet dupe:\r\n\r\nstudy_citation | study_url | study_source_citation\r\n-- | -- | --\r\nhttp://arctos.database.museum/guid/MSB:Mamm:158132 | http://arctos.database.museum/guid/MSB:Mamm:158132 | https://vertnet.org\r\nhttp://arctos.database.museum/guid/MSB:Mamm:158132 | http://arctos.database.museum/guid/MSB:Mamm:158132 | https://vertnet.org\r\n\r\nAll of this may not make much difference to GloBI, but I was trying to determine what percentage of Ixodes interactions were coming from Arctos as opposed to other sources. I also thought it would be interesting to see what percentage of interactions are supported by vouchers, literature or community resources. The duplication means that my \"voucher supported\" numbers are inflated. Anyone else looking at this should be aware of the issue, but also it may not be easy to spot!","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/602/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/602/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
