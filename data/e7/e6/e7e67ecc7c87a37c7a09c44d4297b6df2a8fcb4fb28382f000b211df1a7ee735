I am not quite sure what you feel is incorrect, but I am guessing it's because you don't see \"hom\" show up in some of the matches.  \n\nThis is caused by the fact that the taxonomic rank and all common names are considered for the matching.  Since the suggestions only include english common names and one taxon name  and not the taxonomic tree or path, it might be that the matches are not obvious right away.\n\nFor instance, on inspecting the results at http://trophicgraph.com:8080/findCloseMatchesForTaxon/hom I find that `coriander` has a common name `Phak hom pom`` in Lao (@lo) .  Please confirm that you are seeing the same.  So, I'd say the the matching functionality works, but that the presentation of the results is a bit limiting.  But . . . for now, I am okay with that. . . What do you thing?  Any idea?\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/28135602/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/28135884","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/25#issuecomment-28135884","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/25","id":28135884,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MTM1ODg0","user":{"login":"coding46","id":1724196,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjQxOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1724196?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coding46","html_url":"https://github.com/coding46","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coding46/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coding46/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coding46/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coding46/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coding46/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coding46/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coding46/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coding46/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coding46/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-11-09T20:16:30Z","updated_at":"2013-11-09T20:16:30Z","body":"Right, I forgot that there are „hidden“ results for other languages.
