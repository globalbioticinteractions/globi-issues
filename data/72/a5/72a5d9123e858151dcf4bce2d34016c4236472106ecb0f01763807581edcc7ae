However, the Tri-Trophic project was a consortium that included ca. 40 natural history collections, and specifically included collections that contributed both entomological and botanical data, and association data between plants and insects. I believe that the data derived from the Tri-Trophic project (including data from the TAMUIC) is currently being hosted primarily by iDigBio, who should be contacted for information about accessing those data. In its role as a major biodiversity data aggregator, iDigBio is always looking for new uses of the data, so this is a topic that you should pick up with them. I am copying this note to Gil Nelson, who would be a good person to start your inquiries with at iDigBio.\r\n> Cheers,\r\n> John","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/305252655/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/752807810","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/262#issuecomment-752807810","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/262","id":752807810,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1MjgwNzgxMA==","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-31T01:10:11Z","updated_at":"2020-12-31T01:10:11Z","body":"Tri-trophic data is being indexed via @seltmann 's https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/arthropodEasyCaptureAMNH .\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2020-12-30 17-09-54](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1084872/103389139-de151800-4ac1-11eb-92d3-c0983c77a5e8.png)\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/752807810/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/753076447","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/262#issuecomment-753076447","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/262","id":753076447,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1MzA3NjQ0Nw==","user":{"login":"seltmann","id":1044474,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDQ0NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1044474?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seltmann","html_url":"https://github.com/seltmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seltmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seltmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seltmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seltmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seltmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seltmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seltmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seltmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seltmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-31T20:07:47Z","updated_at":"2020-12-31T20:07:47Z","body":"@jhpoelen @millerse sorry I just saw this thread and I may be able to give a little information (although late).
