As you probably noticed, I used the only a (very) limited subset from Gittenberger interactions to serve as an example. I think it would be a huge contribution if you could capture the many interactions that are actually mentioned in the Gittenberger sources in a separate, more comprehensive dataset. If you have suggestions on how to improve this (novel) data management method (e.g. missing fields, formatting issues), please do let me know!\n\nCurious to see your contributions!\n\n-jorrit\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/64461925/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/66330966","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/68#issuecomment-66330966","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/68","id":66330966,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2MzMwOTY2","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-12-09T18:23:57Z","updated_at":"2014-12-09T18:23:57Z","body":"@millerse transcribed the data from the Gittenberger thesis.
