Here, we calculated the roles of species (as vectors of motif position frequencies) in six well-resolved marine food webs and identified the motif positions associated with the greatest variation in species’ roles. We then tested whether the frequencies of these positions varied with species’ traits. Despite the coarse-grained traits we used, our approach identified several strong associations between traits and motifs.
