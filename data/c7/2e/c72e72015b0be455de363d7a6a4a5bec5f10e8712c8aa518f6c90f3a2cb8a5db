Based on ICTV taxonomy browser, it was first described in a 2020 submission, with the reference genome being MH939438 (see below screenshot).\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a9db5737-52ed-467d-87e0-751091fe3492)\r\n\r\nBased on the GenBank record, the virus was isolated from a leaf in a species found in South Africa within the _Cynodon_ genus, which is a grass. Unfortunately, _Cynodon_ shares the same genus name as a dogtooth characin from South America, likely leading to the assumption that the virus is also found in the vertebrate _Cynodon_ too.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the Virus-Host DB lists both _Cynodon_ as hosts, one being the grass species, and the other being the fish (see below). Both lists RefSeq as their source.\r\n(https://www.genome.jp/virushostdb/2584397)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/35a6b7ff-6ba4-4535-a7c4-eecaa6a24875)\r\n\r\nI found out about this suspicious interaction as I downloaded the list of viruses with host information from Virus-Host DB (https://www.genome.jp/virushostdb/) and was filtered for only \"Vertebrata\" under hosts to look at vertebrate hosts with viruses. Chancing upon this record, with a plant-associated virus, I then went to check GloBI, and found that the fish _Cynodon_ was listed as a host for this pathogen. However, it is a suspicious interaction for the fish being a host for plant associated genomovirus 3 as: (1) the virus was recently described from a plant in Africa, (2) the virus was isolated from a plant with the same genus name as the fish, and (3) the fish is found in South America.

Indeed, it is an unfortunate coincidence that both the fish and the plant shares the same genus name, leading to the confusion across the different databases. I observe the same phenomenon for _Morus_, a genus shared by mulberry and a ganet (bird) (see point 3).\r\n\r\n2. Indeed, the suspicious record originates from the database from VirusHost-DB, due to the record in RefSeq associating it with both the plant and the fish from _Cynodo_.\r\n\r\n3.

While most of the records on virushost-db are correct for mulberry viruses, the record for Mulberry mosaic dwarf associated virus is wrong (see highlighted below).
