The version v3.4.18 appears to running just fine aside from this issue, and upgrade paths exist to switch to a more recent versions when needed. Also note that GloBI is designed to regenerate it's search indexes from versioned source data. This automation makes it relatively easy to switch to a newer version or an entire different index technology if needed.\r\n\r\nAlso, a workaround was implemented and the new setup has been working as expected.
