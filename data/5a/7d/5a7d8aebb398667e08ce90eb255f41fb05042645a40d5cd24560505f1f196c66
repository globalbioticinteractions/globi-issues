This taxonomic name lookup not only enables hierarchical and common name based searches, it also enables the creation of suspicious name reports (names that don't seem to match any supported taxonomic resource).\n\nCurrently, most taxonomic lookups leverage web APIs that are designed to do single name lookups with response times up to 10-30s _per single name lookup_. These response times add up as GloBI grows (currently 1.2M interactions across <100k taxa) and led to a name linking process to takes days to complete (e.g. recent run took ~ 90 hrs). \n\nI've been in touch with @dimus of Global Names and hopefully, we can figure out a way to better leverage libraries and services provided by the global names project (see http://globalnames.org) beyond the integration we already have. I suspect Global Names can help with scientific names, and we'll have to figure out a different solution for common names and image links.\n\nPlease note that projects like GulfBase (http://gulfbase.org/) and Open Tree of Life (http://opentreeoflife.org) made their taxonomies _openly_ available as **file** archives. This allows us to implement fast, offline batch processing with name lookup responses many orders of magnitudes faster than the \"traditional\" web api approaches. \n","closed_by":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/145/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/145/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
