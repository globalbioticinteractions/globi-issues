Some spot checks support that these duplicates are wide spread. \r\n\r\nFrom the history page at https://www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?title=Q608821&action=history , it shows that the bot \"SuccuBot\" (also see https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/User:SuccuBot) was responsible for adding these duplicate entries. It also appears that the same behavior was present for different languages (e.g., CAMPAGNOL BORÉAL and Campagnol Boréal).\r\n\r\nI'll attempt to contact the robot to remove the duplicates. \r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2019-12-09 11-06-49](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1084872/70464592-0cb5f000-1a74-11ea-8b49-bc8ce09e55c5.png)\r\n![Screenshot from 2019-12-09 10-58-03](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1084872/70464545-f314a880-1a73-11ea-90c5-98506a4fae51.png)\r\n![Screenshot from 2019-12-09 11-01-10](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1084872/70464544-f27c1200-1a73-11ea-864d-760b328fd11e.png)\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/434/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/434/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
