It will, but to do so, we need to understand what you mean by Index. Unless we know, we can't provide an API, interface, structured data that might be for your use.\r\n\r\nAlso, there is one more question: what is the right place for you to index Plazi, which depends on what you want. \r\n\r\nRegarding the example please check the agenda of yesterday's meeting where I added the example of Nisitrus vittatus ( Haan, 1844 ).\r\n\r\nWhat I in return would appreciate to see is how we can find out that you reuse the data, and how we can add a (permanent) link to the indexed version of the treatment in GloBI. We have this in place for all the data reused by GBIF. \r\n\r\nHere are the links using the data we liberate: [HTML](https://tb.plazi.org/GgServer/srsStats/stats?outputFields=doc.uuid+doc.doi+doc.zenodoDepId+doc.gbifTaxonId+doc.articleUuid+doc.articleDoi+doc.articleZooBankId+doc.articleGbifId+tax.name+matCit.id+matCit.gbifOccurrenceId&groupingFields=doc.uuid+doc.doi+doc.zenodoDepId+doc.gbifTaxonId+doc.articleUuid+doc.articleDoi+doc.articleZooBankId+doc.articleGbifId+tax.name+matCit.id+matCit.gbifOccurrenceId&FP-doc.articleUuid=FFADFFDCFFECFFFCFFE0F365FFD5FFF9&FP-tax.name=%22Nisitrus%20vittatus%20(Haan%2C%201844)%22&format=HTML) or [JSON](https://tb.plazi.org/GgServer/srsStats/stats?outputFields=doc.uuid+doc.doi+doc.zenodoDepId+doc.gbifTaxonId+doc.articleUuid+doc.articleDoi+doc.articleZooBankId+doc.articleGbifId+tax.name+matCit.id+matCit.gbifOccurrenceId&groupingFields=doc.uuid+doc.doi+doc.zenodoDepId+doc.gbifTaxonId+doc.articleUuid+doc.articleDoi+doc.articleZooBankId+doc.articleGbifId+tax.name+matCit.id+matCit.gbifOccurrenceId&FP-doc.articleUuid=FFADFFDCFFECFFFCFFE0F365FFD5FFF9&FP-tax.name=%22Nisitrus%20vittatus%20(Haan%2C%201844)%22&format=JSON)\r\n\r\nThanks also for mentioning versioning, we have this in the system and accessible. If not obvious, then we can discuss how to make this to your understanding.\r\n\r\nOpen access and editing has a lot to do with governance. Who can edit data, can change structures etc. Do you have such a document for GloBI?  We think about this and would like your input.\r\n\r\nYes, it seems to be confusing what we do under the label \"data liberation\". We try to address this, here are some of my [open access lectures](https://zenodo.org/communities/biosyslit/search?page=1&size=20&q=agosti&type=presentation). I guess, a lot boils down to this often use figure in slide 11 \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4609956/165712438-a3ac9c4b-eca6-4235-94d3-3b6c4bb1f5d3.png) in [DOI](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5569346). This figure also reiterates that we do not create new data, but we enrich a publication with annotations and by adding attributes to them. It also shows, that  we work with use cases, that is our partners for which we provide data that is fit for their use.\r\n\r\nFinally, this is one of the most stupid things we (Plazi) do, and probably also the least understood. Our science world is widely focused on producing and reading, indexing PDFs. At the same time there is a talk of indexing at large scale, big data assuming that the source data is accessible (data avalanche). To bridge this gap is really, really challenging, and we need to stop to make this happen. Publish in  format where all this is done upfront. Examples exist.\r\n\r\nfyi @arw36 @n8upham @qgroom\r\n\r\n\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/1111944915/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
