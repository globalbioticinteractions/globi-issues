There are lots of reasons for this as Zenodo will track the versions for you, so when you come out with a new release of the louse checklist (for example) people can reference not only recent versions but past versions they may have used as well. When taxonomic information is incorporated into GBIF/CoL it is hard for a user to understand what version of the taxonomic list they are actually using and what its original source is. By publishing on Zenodo first, users can reference the DOI to say very clearly \"I used this version of the TPT louse taxonomy.\"\r\n\r\nAnother great reason is you can just point people to the name list. So when you get requests (like ours, or GBIF) you can just send us toward the publication on Zenodo. It will make the name lists very broadly available.\r\n\r\nI am away Friday through next week but I would be happy to meet and discuss methods for publishing the TPT taxonomy.
