On Silhouette Island, the population at Grande Barbe roosts near marshes and feeds heavily on marsh associated Diptera(Ceratopogonidae), with lesser proportions of Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera, and Coleoptera. A second population roosting in boulder caves near palm woodlands at La Passe feeds primarilyin forest gaps. Lepidopterans dominate diet at La Passe, with significant proportions of Hymenopteraand Coleopteraeaten in June-September. In December-March, true weevils in the familyCurculionidae(Coleoptera) are the largest part of the diet, with reduced proportions of Lepidopteraand Hymenoptera. Rock overhangs are used as night roosts during pauses in foraging activity. \r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/1181921008/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/1181924516","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/805#issuecomment-1181924516","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/805","id":1181924516,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACXQt85Gcryk","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-12T15:39:19Z","updated_at":"2022-07-12T15:39:19Z","body":"for the example above: \r\n\r\nColeura seychellensis eats Insecta\r\n\r\nColeura seychellensis eats Diptera\r\nColeura seychellensis eats Ceratopogonidae\r\nColeura seychellensis eats Lepidoptera\r\nColeura seychellensis eats Hymenoptera\r\nColeura seychellensis eats Lepidoptera\r\nColeura seychellensis eats Coleoptera\r\nColeura seychellensis eats Curculionidae\r\nColeura seychellensis eats Coleoptera\r\nColeura seychellensis eats Lepidoptera\r\nColeura seychellensis eats Hymenoptera\r\n\r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/1181924516/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
