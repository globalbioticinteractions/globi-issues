That includes 8 species (all the members of the subgenus Phyllodia).  The citations for this include these papers (plus others): https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1055790316301580 https://academic.oup.com/jmammal/article/99/3/624/4999818 I would use these sources to make sure that I had the list of current species correct, and the ranges correct (this info is all in Batnames.org in this case).  Then, for the associated data sets that I wanted to link, I would look up the geographic points where the data were collected for the association.  Based on these data, I would do follow a \"process of elimination\" exercise  to figure out what species names might apply based on the locality info, also any info in the ecology paper about traits of the bats (in case I could ID the species with that data).  In some cases I would expect an unambiguous resolution; for example, all \"Pteronotus parnellii\" from in Belize are unambiguously now called Pteronotus mesoamericanus.  It gets more complicated where the ranges of more than one \"P. parnellii\" daughter species are now known to overlap (as in parts of South America).  In those areas, one could rule out some names as applying , but not come up with a definitive identification match unless the ecology paper recorded traits of the bats that unambiguously distinguish the species known from the area of the study.
