Do you have any automated checks for the direction of the interaction arrow (e.g. eats vs eaten_by) for source vs target taxa?  This may be a non-issue but scrutinizing the web interface it is not clear that there are no more examples of this 'flip' in the direction of consumer-producer interactions.\r\n\r\nWe also used to find this in a lot of iNaturalist records.\r\n\r\nThanks for your hard work at Globi & all the best,\r\n\r\nDurrell Kapan","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/768/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/768/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
