We are working to collect observations of ground-nesting bee aggregations. Add your photos of bees entering and exiting their nests!\n>\n> Ninety percent of all bees are solitary and seventy percent of bees nest in the ground. Many solitary ground nesting bees provide crucial ecological services that enhance ecosystem resilience, food security and support the agricultural economy, yet our knowledge regarding the ~20,000 species of bees found globally is sorely lacking. This collaboration will provide a platform for citizens to help map ground nesting bee aggregations that will aid in understanding resource requirements of native bees and promote their conservation. We will integrate nesting location data with mathematical modeling of biotic and abiotic GPS data layers, to identify habitat with comparable land cover, aspect, topography, and soil characteristics. The resulting maps will help guide the discovery of additional nesting sites and provide the parameter attributes required to establish new breeding populations of bees to meet ecological and agricultural objectives.\n>\n>We request a photo of the ground that shows the nest entrance or entrances, and a photo of the bee or bees. A picture of a bee entering or exiting a nest entrance is ideal. Please see preliminary examples. Also please add an estimate of aggregation size using (1, 10, 100, 1,0000, 10,000 or 100,0000).\n>\n>Additionally, if possible, please capture a slow-motion video of the bees in flight. These videos are wonderful for gaining a general idea of the scale of the nesting aggregations. Please send videos to [groundnestingbees@gmail.com](mailto:groundnestingbees@gmail.com)\n>\n> Know: Ground nesting bees (which are typically solitary by nature) are not aggressive. However, social ground nesting wasps can be.\n>\n> Together, we will work to support the native pollinator communities for which we all depend.[ less ↑](https://inaturalist.ca/projects/ground-nesting-bees-3e6882c0-a112-4ddb-b043-1da25638ce96#)","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/1122/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/1122/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
