Same for targetTaxonName. So, if the taxon rank of the column is fixed, I try to map it to a taxon rank specific column.\r\n2. for readme.md - for the badges to work, please make sure to include the [user] or [org] name of the github repository when running ```elton init .... [username]/[repo name]``` so instead of ```elton init ... olito2015``` try ```elton init ... zedomel/olito2015``` . Suggest to manually fix the readme.md links from ```globi:olito2015``` -> ```globi:zedomel/olito2015``` . Similar with the travis link.\r\n\r\nI am glad that you share the same sentiment about the xsl(x) formats. I hope that publishers will also start to see the benefits of straight text files like csv/tsv and no longer accept xls files as supplements / attachments.\r\n\r\nI hope that these comments are helpful to you.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/818328714/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/820770592","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/629#issuecomment-820770592","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/629","id":820770592,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgyMDc3MDU5Mg==","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-15T22:36:39Z","updated_at":"2021-04-15T22:36:39Z","body":"@zedomel thanks for adding your index configuration for Olito et al. 2015 at https://github.com/zedomel/olito2015 .
