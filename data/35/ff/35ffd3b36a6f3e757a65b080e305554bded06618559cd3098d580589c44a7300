I much agree that definitions and a little more organized used of terms would help others to more easily discover and understand existing species interaction datasets. To help implement your idea and am trying to figure out how to discuss/address them. \r\n\r\nFor instance, for item 1. , you mention:\r\n\r\n> Since many interactions in GLOBI are not provided through academic sources, I think \"study\" should be replaced.\r\n\r\nWhat terms would be more appropriate than the current ones?
