Whenever a \"visits flower of\" is selected, it also includes \"pollinates\" interactions. I am assuming the more explicit \"pollinates\" involve a flower being visited at some point. Please let me know if you'd like to discuss this further.\n\nThanks for all your contributions and let me know if you find any funny data related to the introduction of the recent flower visit interaction - happy to help and fix.\n\n-jorrit\n\nfrom http://www.globalbioticinteractions.org/#sourceTaxon=Archilochus%20alexandri&interactionType=visitsFlowersOf : \n![screen shot 2015-07-31 at 10 08 34 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1084872/9012751/26839d74-376c-11e5-8c28-1d405104e93e.png)\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/126755234/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
