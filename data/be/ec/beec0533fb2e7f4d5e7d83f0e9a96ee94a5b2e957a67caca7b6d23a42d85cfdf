This leads to scattered and inconsistently structured information that lacks a standardized vocabulary. Additionally, the security and safety of WH data are usually poor. Consequently, WH data are lost, not usable, and their integration and sharing are inefficient or unfeasible. These limitations weaken comprehensive health risk assessments, restrict the integration of the environmental sector into One Health systems, and reduce the effectiveness of responses to environmental, animal, and human health crises.Well-designed databases are essential to addressing these challenges. Yet, access to comprehensive databases remains a significant barrier in WH surveillance. Existing platforms are often private, costly, limited in scope, or accessibility, whilst underfunding of WH surveillance hampers the development of digital infrastructure.To address this gap, Wildlife Conservation Society is leading the development of a WH surveillance purpose-built database with a comprehensive hierarchical data structure designed by a globally distributed and diverse group of experts (the Wildlife Health Intelligence Network). The database can harmonize and centralize diverse data from multiple sources, keep data secured in the long-term, and facilitate accessibility and sharing to selected receivers. Interoperability with platforms holding WH surveillance data (e.g., dead animal reported in iNaturalist) or interested on these data for monitoring purposes (e.g., parasites into GBIF) will be supported, allowing on-the-fly WH data integration and ensure participation of stakeholders in WH surveillance by continuing the use of their preferred systems (e.g., rangers using SMART Mobile).Conceived as a global public good, the database proposes a collaborative model driven by continuous user feedback and shared maintenance costs, while protecting data safety and ownership through strict compartmentalization within and among organizations. Scheduled for 2025, the database is coming to fill a longstanding gap in the management of WH surveillance data.\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1509\" height=\"650\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a516840c-62ce-41a4-b3fb-ed57263745ad\" />\n\n<img width=\"1509\" height=\"650\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e4eeff5-397b-446e-b40e-488ce2323975\" />","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/1109/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/1109/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
