And, I am note quite sure whether folks would want to be acknowledged as data contributors. Do you think it'd be wise to populate the folks mentioned in the EML as data contributors by default without asking them? \n\n> How do we link those publications to our Google Scholar?\n\nThe indexing methods of Google Scholar appears to be proprietary. According to Gerasimov et al. 2024 (see above), Google Scholar is flexible on what they index, and do not just restrict their citation discovery to scientific journals, but also include sources that are deemed trusted.\n\nFor instance, some data reviews (not all!) published via https://depot.globalbioticinteractions.org/reviews/ are being indexed (see screeenshot of https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=nomer+review+globalbioticinteractions below), whereas the same data reviews deposits in Zenodo's GloBI Review community have yet to show up.  \n\n> If they are added to Google Scholar, do the citation counts show up for the collection? \n\nIf they are added, I would assume that these citations to this indexed data review would show up on the review's google scholar record. \n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fac62a3e-c54c-4796-af59-e4cad414c665)","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/2960249627/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/2960258168","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/1077#issuecomment-2960258168","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/1077","id":2960258168,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACXQt86wcfR4","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-06-10T18:38:57Z","updated_at":"2025-06-10T18:41:42Z","body":"So, for now, actionable items are:\n\n1. populate data contributors mentioned in EML when depositing data review to Zenodo\n2. explore use of newer (undocumented) zenodo deposit metadata format to publish an abstract text section separate from the technical information describing the review and their outcomes. \n3. explore ways to add organizations / collections to EML as separate entities along with their ROR and GRSciColl identifiers, with a workaround by adding these identifiers to globi.json or alternative identifiers alignment/association service (nomer?)

For getting the data reviews indexed, we are either at the mercy of the Google Scholar black box, or we can explore ways to get these reviews published in journals such as Pensoft's Research Ideas and Outcomes (RIO, paging @Daniel-Mietchen) or Biodiversity Data Journal (BDJ). A hint to this was discussed in #1014 .\n5. For inclusion on the Ecdysis profile page, we can point straight to the DOI associated data review by doing a lookup by their dataset guid . Idea: on loading a profile page, ecdysis portal queries GloBI API by some collection GUID/doi (whichever one in mentioned in the EML/DwC-A provided), then API provides a) a svg badge indicating whether a review is available b) a redirect to the associated review doi and/or c) a result that includes the associated DOI url as a result. \n\n@seltmann Curious to hear your take on items 1-5, and which do you think would be useful to work on first.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/2960280824/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
