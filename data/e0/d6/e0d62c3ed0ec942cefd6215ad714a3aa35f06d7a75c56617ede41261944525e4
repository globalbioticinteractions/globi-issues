These data were collected to investigate temporal variation in plant-pollinator interactions; specifically, these data were collected in a manner to allow for the construction of weekly plant-pollinator interaction networks in order to investigate fine scale temporal variation in plant-pollinator interactions. The data represent extensive community-wide field observations of animal pollinators visiting flowering plants in a subalpine ecosystem for the majority of the summer growing season (May–September).  \",\r\n  \"dataset_keywords\": \"\",\r\n  \"dataset_year\": 2020,\r\n  \"dataset_metadata_eml\": \"\",\r\n  \"dataset_type\": \"plant-pollinator\",\r\n  \"dwc_interaction_term\": \"\",\r\n  \"dwc_interaction_term_values\": \"\",\r\n  \"columns_keys\": \"\",\r\n  \"columns_keys_to_dwc\": \"\",\r\n  \"interactions_types\": \"visitsFlowerOf\",\r\n  \"interactions_types_iris\": \"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002622\",\r\n  \"interaction_level\": \"species-species\",\r\n  \"record_level\": \"species\",\r\n  \"repo_url\": \"https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/27dc02fe1655e3896f20326fed5cb95f\",\r\n  \"dataset_url\": \"\",\r\n  \"GloBI issue\": \"\",\r\n  \"Notes\": \"\",\r\n  \"GloBI URL\": \"\",\r\n  \"relational model\": \"single\"\r\n}\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/628/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/628/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
