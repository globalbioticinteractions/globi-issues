Contains over 9k species interactions focused on trees and their consumers/ seed dispersers. \n\n---\n\nDear colleagues,\n\nIt has been about 3 years since we launched the Africa Tree Database and about that long now since most of us corresponded about it! Over the last few months, I've worked to get the data we painstakingly entered into a more findable, shareable, and citable format. Thank you to Bill for helping with this process.\n\nHere are permanent links to each of the datasets on figshare:\n·      Plant-animal interactions from Africa. http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1526128\n·      Common names of African trees. http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1526129\n·      SQL of Africa Tree Database. http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1526125\n·      Seed characteristics of African trees. http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1526135\n·      Fruit characteristics of African trees. http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1526131\n·      Growth form (habit) of African trees. http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1526132\n·      Medicinal uses of African plants. http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1526133\n·      Non-medicinal uses of African trees. http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1526136\n\nThe main motivation behind this has been to make the 9000 records of interactions available for incorporation into the Global Biotic Interactions (GloBI) project (see some fabulous visualizations on their blog). I've copied Jorrit Poelen (GloBI) and Jen Hammock (EOL) so that they can incorporate the additional data directly from figshare. \n\nI am unsure how to contact Jamie, Aaron, and Jordan. Could you pass this along to them if you know how to get in touch?\n\nThank you all for your part in this project to disseminate knowledge about African trees. Please let me know if you have any questions. \n\nBest,\nCarrie\n## \n\nCarrie E.
