We are happy to hear that our project has reached you, and that you would be interested in indexing our resource. I informed with my co-authors to check who has spare time to invest in our making the resource more interoperable, but unfortunately we have since the publication all moved on to other projects.For this reason, nobody is able to commit to helping you with the integration. One option that we are considering, is making this integration part of a student project, but we cannot guarantee that this will result in a meaningful contribution. If your request in bounded by a certain timeframe, we would also suggest that you try to fork our repository and work on the integration yourself to ensure a timely completion of the project. We are very sorry, but unfortunately we cannot provide much more assistance as we need to be careful with picking up additional workload in our already busy agenda. If we do manage to find a student, we would need extra instructions on how to ensure proper data integration. The link that was send earlier lo longer appear to work. All in all, we wish you the best of luck. We are sorry we cannot be of much more help, but we appreciate your effort of reaching out to us.Kind regards,RittenOn Sep 5, 2024 15:29, Anderson Silva ***@***.***> wrote:\nGive this a shot\nhttps://bit.ly/4eaAnWN\nPasscode: changeme\nyou must have a gcc compiler\n\n—Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub, or unsubscribe.You are receiving this because you were mentioned.Message ID: ***@***.***>","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/2338452028/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/2455804107","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/1012#issuecomment-2455804107","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/1012","id":2455804107,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACXQt86SYJjL","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-11-04T22:10:39Z","updated_at":"2024-11-04T22:10:39Z","body":"Hi @Ritten11 - Just took a stab at indexing your host-pest claims in a forked repo at https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/companion-planting-decision-support . \r\n\r\nWould you be open to merging a pull request with the index configuration so that GloBI can index your dataset in the source repository instead of a fork? \r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/2455804107/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/2471013623","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/1012#issuecomment-2471013623","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/1012","id":2471013623,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACXQt86TSKz3","user":{"login":"Ritten11","id":32358151,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzU4MTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32358151?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ritten11","html_url":"https://github.com/Ritten11","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ritten11/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ritten11/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ritten11/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ritten11/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ritten11/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ritten11/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ritten11/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ritten11/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ritten11/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-11-12T16:36:11Z","updated_at":"2024-11-12T16:36:11Z","body":"Hi Jorrit,\r\n\r\nThank you for making the effort!
