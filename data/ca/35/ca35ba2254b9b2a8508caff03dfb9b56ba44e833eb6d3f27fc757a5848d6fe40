The main challenge is as you say in text mining the metadata fields. Parsing some of the supposedly structured data in GenBank can be a challenge, never mind the unstructured data! Evaluating automated methods is also challenging (but this is perhaps something that curated data and knowledge in eol-globi could potentially help with).\n\nIf you have results that look interesting it would be great to add them. A crucial piece of metadata would be the evidence type - in this case something like \"inferred from text matching\".\n\nI didn't know about the Chen and Sarkar paper, cool.

Someone has asserted that \"x\" is hosted by \"y\", and this assertion has at least two identifiers: the GenBank sequence accession, and the associated publication identifier (e.g., PMID, DOI).\n2. What \"y\" is. It might be a simple taxon name, or something more complicated from which we have to figure out the name.\n\nRegarding 1, being able to say \"x\" is hosted by \"y\" according to DOI:z strikes me as useful if we want to keep track of evidence for a particular association.\n\nAm I correct that there's no particular data format here, you basically want data in as clean a form as possible, and presumably easy to parse?

I had a chat with Chris and we'd very much like to receive your csv export described above and incorporate it into the GloBI datasets.  After we get the data flowing we should come up with alternate ways to express the data if needed.   About the sharing of your dataset: for some previously contributed datasets, we have received copies and added them to our data repository.  For others, we are using (stable, permanent) uri's to retrieve and ingest the datasets.  Either way works great, although the latter has the advantage for you to be able to update the dataset and have the changes propagate in GloBI without any \"paperwork\": the GloBI datasets are ingested nightly using an automated process.
