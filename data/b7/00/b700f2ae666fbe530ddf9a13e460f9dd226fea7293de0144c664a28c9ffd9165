The underscores should be taken into account whenever a new GloBI taxon graph is built. Also, the funny ```Bombus_terrestris/lucorum``` notation might cause some issue, but these can be handled later.\r\n\r\nSo, what i'd suggest, just map them and open an issue on the resulting GloBI configuration repository re: the ```Bombus_terrestris/lucorum``` names.
