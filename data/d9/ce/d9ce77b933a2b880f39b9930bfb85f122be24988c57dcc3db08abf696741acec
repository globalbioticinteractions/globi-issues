With methods described in http://www.globalbioticinteractions.org/2017/01/24/lifestages-of-species-interaction-datasets/ , I was able to detect and fix the issue. To make the datasets a little more resilient, I've included cached copies of the data files used in the respective github repositories. See e.g. Barnes et al. 2008 at https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/barnes . This way, github, zenodo and figshare would have to go down for data to be lost.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/292389711/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
