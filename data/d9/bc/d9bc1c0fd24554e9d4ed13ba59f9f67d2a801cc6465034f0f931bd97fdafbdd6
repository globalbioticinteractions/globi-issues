For many observations, the locality Ids are not available, where I try to use locality names. In such cases, I come across names like \"Sonora\" which can be the \"Sonora\" from different countries  (BR, CA, CO, CR, CU, GT, HN, IN, MX, US, VE). Some observations have the country name inside the the value for localityName, which may not be helpful in cases where large chunks of data has to be evaluated. Maybe, one can include a column name \"Country\" with the country name or better country codes according to Geonames.\r\n\r\n-DT","closed_by":{"login":"mdrishti","id":49712124,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NzEyMTI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49712124?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdrishti","html_url":"https://github.com/mdrishti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdrishti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdrishti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdrishti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdrishti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdrishti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdrishti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdrishti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdrishti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdrishti/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/1015/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/1015/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"}
