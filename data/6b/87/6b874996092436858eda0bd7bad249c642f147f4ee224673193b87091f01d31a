These interactions are used uniformly throughout the dataset but do not necessarily have a uniform meaning. \r\n\r\nAlso regarding this issue, the OBO library site states on the interaction type 'ecologically related to' '_Do not use this relation directly. It is intended as a grouping for a diverse set of relations, all involving ecological interactions_'\r\n[https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/ro/properties?iri=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FRO_0002321&lang=en&viewMode=All&siblings=false]\r\nMany of the interactions within the GloBI dataset are documented with EcologicallyRelatedTo\r\n\r\n- How does this happen, &\r\n- How should one account for these issues when analysing the dataset?\r\n\r\nKind regards, \r\nBarbara Meulenbelt","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/887/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/887/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
