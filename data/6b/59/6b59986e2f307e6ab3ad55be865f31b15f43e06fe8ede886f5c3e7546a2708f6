I can totally understand if you'd like to hold off until I can provide complete coverage of the iNaturalist interaction data. But hey, I figured that pretty good is better than not at all.\n\n@JRice So, while I enjoy the mental and semi-physical exercise to get a reasonably complete picture of links between iNaturalist <> EOL. . . I would like to request two EOL features to make this is a little more straight forward:\n1. Have a way to get a (machine readable) notification after a successful ingestion (e.g. webhook perhaps?). Right now I have to eye ball some webpage to see whether a new version of GloBI is up.\n2. (more importantly) get a list of all data point uris (and associated GloBI ids) that are associated to GloBI provided data\n\nThanks again for listening . . . and @kueda let me know how you'd like to proceed.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/76111209/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/76173971","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/115#issuecomment-76173971","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/115","id":76173971,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2MTczOTcx","user":{"login":"JRice","id":24174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JRice","html_url":"https://github.com/JRice","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JRice/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JRice/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JRice/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JRice/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JRice/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JRice/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JRice/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JRice/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JRice/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-02-26T13:00:58Z","updated_at":"2015-02-26T13:00:58Z","body":"> 1.

One observation documenting a single interaction seems to map to multiple interactions on EOL, e.g. http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/1158453 maps to http://eol.org/pages/5870542/data#data_point_16720422, http://eol.org/pages/32539/data#data_point_16720192, and http://eol.org/pages/472631/data#data_point_17585196, even though they're all basically the same interaction with different taxonomic ranks and cardinalities. We really just want to provide a single link to show \"Hey, this other site is making use of your data!\" as opposed to an arbitrary number of links that look like, \"GloBI, GloBI, GloBI.\" We can just choose a single interaction per observation, but it would be nicer to have a URL that represents the single interaction documented on iNat as seen on your system, maybe with links from that page to the derivative interactions at different ranks and cardinalities.\n2. What's up with the \"interacts with\" interaction type? My impression as a user is, \"I put some effort into documenting a specific interaction, but this other site abstracted that into something that has less specific meaning.\" Maybe you guys could include the interaction type in your CSV and we could just choose them selectively.\n3. Why isn't http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/1158453 represented on EOL as the interaction between the two taxa documented on iNat? I'm seeing \"Ferraria interacts with Camponotus,\" \"Camponotus niveosetosus interacts with Iridaceae,\" and \"Camponotus interacts with Iridaceae,\" but _not_ \"Camponotus niveosetosus interacts with Ferraria,\" which is the actual interaction documented on iNat, or any of the other possible combinations of ranks and cardinality.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/76512174/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/76778139","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/115#issuecomment-76778139","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/115","id":76778139,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2Nzc4MTM5","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-02T18:50:15Z","updated_at":"2015-03-02T18:50:15Z","body":"Thanks for sharing these issues! \n\n**Re 1. one-to-many mapping** of iNaturalist observations. I can see your point and agree it is a bit strange to have multiple icons pointing to all the places where the inat interaction is referenced. A GloBI page pointing to all the different customer urls would provide a nice way to show folks how their interaction is used without cluttering the iNaturalist UI, I've created a separate issue #120 . Let me know if I captured your idea properly. Also, the reason why a single observation is referenced many times is because of interaction inversion (e.g. bunny -[:eats]-> carrot and  carrot -[:eaten by] -> bunny) in combination with a bit of taxonomic reasoning as described in issue #79 . \n\n**Re 2. interaction mapping** - I was hoping you were going to ask how interaction types are mapped! GloBI is using a controlled vocabulary whenever possible ([obo relation ontology (RO)](http://www.ontobee.org/browser/term.php?o=RO&iri=http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl%23ObjectProperty&graph=http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/merged/RO)), I manually have to create the mapping between the iNaturalist observation field and subset of RO terms (see  http://api.globalbioticinteractions.org/interactionTypes, note that we can add new interaction types whenever needed). My current interaction map can be found [here](https://github.com/jhpoelen/eol-globi-data/blob/master/eol-globi-data-sources/src/main/java/org/eol/globi/data/StudyImporterForINaturalist.java#L36). Ideally, I would like to have this mapping sit closer to the user, ideally, have a way to associate these terms to \"standard\" terms in iNaturalist itself. Is there a way for curators (or curator bots?) to add observations fields or annotate existing ones with pointers to GloBI interaction terms? \n\n**Re 3. missing references** - Some references were missing due to a bug in my code. I have made a change and regenerated the provider consumer links. Let me know if the links are now complete.\n\nWould you like to hold off with integration until #120 is implemented?\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/76778139/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/77426692","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/115#issuecomment-77426692","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/115","id":77426692,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3NDI2Njky","user":{"login":"kueda","id":22691,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNjkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22691?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kueda","html_url":"https://github.com/kueda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kueda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kueda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kueda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kueda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kueda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kueda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kueda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kueda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kueda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-05T18:58:52Z","updated_at":"2015-03-05T18:58:52Z","body":"1.
