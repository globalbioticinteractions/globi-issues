This format is useful for search indexes like Lucene. While the format contains all the taxonomic data, it proves tricky for data consumers (e.g., R users) to combine the taxonPath and taxonPathName when searching for specific ranks.\r\n\r\nAs suggested in various discussions including a recent one with @iamciera @liyikang1997 , a more explicit solution is proposed, were ranks are normalized and explicitly mentioned as columns (e.g., speciesName, speciesId, ...).
