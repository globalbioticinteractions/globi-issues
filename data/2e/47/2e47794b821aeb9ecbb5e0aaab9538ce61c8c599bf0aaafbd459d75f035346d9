Negated records would allow for also showing refuting evidence. In a web UI, this might look like:\r\n\r\n![refuteandsupport](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1084872/47377235-8d1b6500-d6a9-11e8-86c5-8ae66c80706e.png)\r\n\r\nNote that the refuting claim text is an example.\r\n\r\nThe idea of refuting records to detect unlikely interactions consists of:\r\n\r\n1. Making a general claim about species interactions:\r\n    Big things are unlikly parasites of smaller things.\r\n2. Making a suggestion:\r\n    Did you mean that the small things is a parasite of the big thing? \r\n3. Erroneous reversal happens a lot.\r\n    How to record / show this? How to count these frequently occurring quality issues? How to get folks to flag or report these quality issues?\r\n\r\n\r\nSolutions:\r\n\r\n1. iNaturalist can make their treatment of species interaction fields more formal. lifeStage / sex / phenology . thumbs up/down. Quality control at the source. \r\n\r\n2. iNaturalist has an commenting API and GloBI uses it to automatically flag the record. Social solution. Pros/cons - pro: automated and using some funny interaction detection algorithm - con: generate many true positives (flooding iNaturalist with \"thumbs down\" on some records), possibility for false error reports due to bugs in automated flagging, creates expectation that you engage in a conversation between experts (similar to conversations related to freshdata feedback loops).   \r\n\r\n3. Quality tool hosts by GloBI that works with any dataset, not just iNaturalist. Pros: no need to build a new feedback loop for each dataset Cons: potentially hard to find, because users probably have to switch platforms/ websites. \r\n\r\n4. A specific quality tool would allow data consumers to filter out records that match some specific rules. These rules can be applied on the record or dataset level.  \r\n\r\nExample of 4.\r\n\r\nAllow users to create rules easily. Marine fishes are unlikely consumers of terrestrial spiders. Use some table with four columns: \r\n\r\n    rule: (sourceTaxon | interactionTypeId/Name | isNegated (~ likeliness, 0 -> not likely) | targetTaxon | claimCodeId (~basisOfRecord) | claimCodeLabel | user id/orcid authority) .  \r\n    cross-reference interaction records (aka apply rules) and suggestion process: \r\n        (application of rules) based on rule X, interaction records Y is unlikely. \r\n        (permutation of the interaction record) However, if interaction record Y is reversed, the interaction is likely. \r\n        (suggestion) Did you perhaps reverse the interaction? \r\n\r\nVery much in line with TDWG Quality group and their framework.\r\nSimilar to basic quality checks in Elton (static rules applied to each record in a dataset).\r\n\r\nWho has authority? Which rules should be applied? Only rules/record with negated interaction claims should be applied in the quality checks.\r\n\r\nStart out with a general table in a specific rule dataset. This dataset would initially only include negated interaction records offered by experts that are willing to put their name to it. Get in touch via ORCID id / github profile / email / url .
