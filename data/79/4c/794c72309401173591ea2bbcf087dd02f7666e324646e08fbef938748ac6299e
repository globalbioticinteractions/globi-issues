In the interaction is treated as \"hemiparasite-host\" (https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hemiparasite)\r\nThe partial parasitism is a property of the parasite plant, but the other plant is treated as the host, like in any other \"parasite-host\" interaction. \r\nBut I think that should be interest to have the inverse relation, so we can say *the object has hemiparasitized the subject*, explicit indicating that the subject is a partial parasite. Saying that *the object has host the subject* we may loosing information. Don't you think?\r\n\r\nMaybe it is missing in RO, since other child terms of \"host of\" have the respective inverse relation (e.g. \"has ectoparasite\", \"kleptoparasitized by\").\r\n\r\nPerhaps @cmungall  has explanation for that.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/1261534781/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
