It might change a small amount as we refine for final publication, but, we wanted to put it into GLOBI as soon as possible, as we'd like to use both these and other interactions already in the database for our final product.\r\n\r\nThe database is on github, so it can be easily updated. It also has a complete reference list along with it, associated by a Study ID key.\r\n\r\nHappy to do any additional work on it as needed.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/jebyrnes/ne_marsh_food_web","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/299/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/299/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
