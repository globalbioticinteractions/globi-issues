One with all interaction observations and other with distinct interaction observations aggregated by study. \n\nIn the future, we'd like to introduce an additional one. This darwin core archive expands the interaction observations for lower order taxa up to the taxon rank of order. This would make it easier for GloBI data consumers like http://eol.org to get an overview of interaction summaries of higher order taxonomic ranks. \n\nFor instance, if a sea otter (_Enhydra lutris_) is observed eating a red rock crab (_Cancer productus_), then the otter's higher order taxa Enhydra, Mustelidae etc will also be associated to that same interaction with the red rock crab. \n\nThis taxon interaction roll-up will happen up-until the `order` rank. Also the number of inferred interactions will be limited to 15,000 per higher order taxonomic rank.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/79/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/79/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
