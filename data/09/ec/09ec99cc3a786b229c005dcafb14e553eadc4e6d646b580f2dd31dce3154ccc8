The primary taxon id the first taxon match to be resolved for a specific interaction record. For instance, primary taxon ids for interactions mined from inaturalist will start with \"INAT_TAXON\" and point to inaturalist taxon ids. Non-primary ids are \"similar\" taxon ids found in other naming sources. You can currently search by primary and non-primary taxon results. However, in the search results, only the primary taxon id is included. \r\n\r\nIn #252 @kueda expressed a desire to map all results following a search to a specific taxonomic id provider (in this case inaturalist), along the lines of ... /interaction?sourceTaxon=...&nameIdProvider=inat . This would include mapping for both inaturalist *and* non-inaturalist interactions.\r\n\r\n@kueda - please feel free to chime in if I missed anything here.
