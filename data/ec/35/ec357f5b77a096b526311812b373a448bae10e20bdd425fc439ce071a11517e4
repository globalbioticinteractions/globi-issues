All datasets that are included in GloBI have a certain way of identifying the species encountered in their research. Because many naming databases exist, one species has different identifiers (e.g. homo sapiens is GBIF:2436436, ITIS:180092 and EOL:327955), also known as the heterogeneity problem. For this reason, I chose to to ontology matching with one database for all taxa and their higher taxonomic ranks. As using the GBIF ontology resulted in the maximum number of remaining interaction rows (out of ITIS, COL and GBIF) it was chosen for matching.\r\n\r\nThe GBIF parser to match names with, was inconsistent in matching the names. When matching the data, the amount of rows in the dataset had a different amount of interaction rows per run. Between some runs the difference was 400.000 interaction rows. This is a large difference and means that not all data available is obtained when not performing accurately. \r\n\r\n- Can you tell me how these differences are found?\r\n- How can I best deal with these inconsistencies? (My current (imperfect) solution was to just match all my sets on one day so they all dealt with the same status of the set through matching)\r\n\r\nKindest regards, \r\nBarbara Meulenbelt","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/889/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/889/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
