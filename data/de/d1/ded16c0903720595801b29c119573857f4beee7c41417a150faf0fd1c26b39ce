The work you and your colleagues are doing is pretty amazing, and I am hoping to amplify your work by reusing it.\r\n\r\nsome ideas on use cases for researchers, infrastructure maintainers, and \"big data\" folks.\r\n\r\nAs a researcher, I would like to explore structured digital forms of taxonomic texts as provided by Plazi linked through some existing infrastructure like GBIF, GloBI, Encyclopedia of Life, Wikipedia as well as Plazi's own infrastructure.\r\n\r\nAs an infrastructure maintainer (in this case GloBI), I need fast and reliable access the Plazi corpus. While APIs serve their purpose in exploration and web page integration, a (versioned) whole dataset corpus like https://github.com/plazi/treatments-rdf would be needed to efficiently integrate species interaction related or taxonomic information into existing GloBI indexes and interpreted datasets. \r\n\r\nAs a \"big data\" researcher, my needs are similar to those of an infrastructure maintainer - I need fast access to the full versioned corpus of data so that I can run algorithms that are reproducable and not constrained by internet bandwidth or (understandable) web API constraints like response time, rate limits, and pagination. \r\n\r\nCurious to hear your thoughts!","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/1112334664/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
