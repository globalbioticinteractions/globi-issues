I poke around a little and found that we might be able to automate downloading the csv files using some url patterns and lists of species codes. \n\nFor instance, European mackerel (_Scomber scomberus_) data can be retrieved by using code `MAC`. with a list of all ICES areas `V1a, VIIIb` . . . and years `2011, 2010, ...` and resulting in a url pointing to the csv - \n\nhttps://www.cefas.co.uk/umbraco/CefasPlugins/DapstomSurface/Download?searchType=predator&species=MAC&years=2011&years=2010&years=2006&years=2005&years=2004&years=1991&years=1987&years=1986&years=1979&years=1978&years=1977&years=1976&years=1974&years=1972&years=1965&years=1956&years=1919&years=1917&years=1907&years=1906&years=1902&years=1901&years=1899&areas=VIIIb&areas=Va&areas=VIa&areas=VIIj&areas=XIVa&areas=VIIId&areas=VIIIc&areas=XIVb&areas=IIa&areas=VIIg&areas=VIIh&areas=IVc&areas=VIIIa&areas=VIIe&areas=VIIf&areas=IVa&areas=IVb&areas=VIIa&minlength=0&maxlength=1000&nullLengths=true\n\nAfter chopping off the headers and concatenating the files, you should be able to recreate the whole dapstrom dataset. Also, I can show you how to point GloBI to non-standard columns and pick up the predator/prey. Perhaps time for a little mini-workshop by skype? \n\nReason why I am a big fan of automation is because it is easier to fix mistakes (I always make a mistake or two) and add new data (looks like Dapstrom is an active project). \n\nCurious to hear your thoughts.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/217183755/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/217225886","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/178#issuecomment-217225886","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/178","id":217225886,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNzIyNTg4Ng==","user":{"login":"millerse","id":9950335,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5NTAzMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9950335?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/millerse","html_url":"https://github.com/millerse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/millerse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/millerse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/millerse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/millerse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/millerse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/millerse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/millerse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/millerse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/millerse/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-05T17:55:08Z","updated_at":"2016-05-05T17:55:08Z","body":"Sure.
