You may want to look at the application we built at U Maryland that used all of these data to see all the facets that are available for each link:\nhttp://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/biodiversity/#EcoLens\n(the application only runs on Windows machines and I don't have easy access to that now, nor do I know if it currently works)\n\nIn any case here are the metadata elements that should be available and that I would ask you to add to your repository and to the resource file for EOL.  For example, Eats Mollusks here has no additional metadata other than \"SPIRE\" on this page http://eol.org/pages/328615/data\n\nFor each relationship between two taxa there should be:\nA bibliographic reference for the study whence the data originally came (except ADW -- I think you often but perhaps don't always have this -- if it is ADW the reference can be Myers, P., R. Espinosa, C. S. Parr, T. Jones, G. S. Hammond, and T. A. Dewey. 2013. The Animal Diversity Web (online). Accessed at http://animaldiversity.org.)\nA \"compiler\" which is the metastudy where I got the info (ADW is an example of a compiler -- EOL can handle this attribution role if GLoBI can)\nA year that the data were collected (or published, I'm not totally sure) \nA country (they all have at least this)\nA state (where relevant)\nA locality (where known)\nA habitat (from a controlled vocabulary -- see the panel on the left side of http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/biodiversity/images/ecoLens.png)\n\nIt would be ideal to have these as metadata for the links you are storing, because we are already getting people who are interested in looking at spatial (and potentially temporal) variation.  The links from SPIRE are not linked to specific specimen or observation records but there is enough metadata to assist in queries having to do with location or habitat.\n\nIf you cannot find these data in the DB tables you have been working with let me know and I'll email a ZIP file with text tables.\n\nAlso, at some point we will want to remove the ADW links from the SPIRE resource and get them directly from ADW because they've undoubtedly improved over the last eight years or so.  That can be a separate ticket.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/28/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/28/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
