curator of the collection, Danae Frier,  was kind enough to answer the following questions:\r\n\r\nQ1.

Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ2.

Yes, but I am cc'ing Ray Poulin in in case he has anything to add, as he processed many of the pellets and developed the original spreadsheet.\r\n\r\nQ3. I notice you are using date formatting like \"4/25/2008\" instead of the (recommended) ISO8601 format \"2008-04-25\" . Is there any way I can convince you to change to this date format?\r\n\r\n> A3.
