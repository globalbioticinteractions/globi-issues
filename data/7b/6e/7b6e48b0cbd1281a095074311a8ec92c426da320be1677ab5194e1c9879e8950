For instance, [KerpForest database](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0109356) uses an [ITIS taxon id 167353](http://www.itis.gov/servlet/SingleRpt/SingleRpt?search_topic=TSN&search_value=167353) (_Scorpaenichthys marmoratus_  (Girard, 1854)) that has been marked as invalid. ITIS does provide a valid name associated with it, namely [_Scorpaenichthys marmoratus_ (Ayres, 1854)](http://www.itis.gov/servlet/SingleRpt/SingleRpt?search_topic=TSN&search_value=692068). \n\nCurrently, the EOL taxon hierarchy API does not seem to support resolving \"invalid\" ITIS taxon ids  to their valid ones, meaning that the invalid names show up in the unresolved names list (see [taxonomic matching wiki](https://github.com/jhpoelen/eol-globi-data/wiki/Taxonomy-Matching)). \n\nAssuming that we'd like to follow invalid names to their valid replacements, we need to either (a) convince EOL to include invalid names in their meta taxonomy or (b) implement this behavior in GloBI's taxonomic matching engine using ITIS's web API, similar to the approach taken for [WoRMS](http://marinespecies.org).\n\n@jhammock @KatjaSchulz are you aware that \"invalid\" ITIS taxon ids are excluded from EOL's \"meta\" taxonomy? Is there any way to convince you to include invalid names and redirect to the valid one (if available)?\n","closed_by":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/110/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/110/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
