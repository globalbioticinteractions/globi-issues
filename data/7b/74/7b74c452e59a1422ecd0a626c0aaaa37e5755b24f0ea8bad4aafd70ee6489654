Also, some GloBI indexed datasets are large and more than 50 minutes to review on travis builders. \r\n\r\nSo, in order to have more control over the dataset review process and to avoid increasing (money) overhead, alternative review environments/process should be considered.\r\n\r\nLuckily, the GloBI data review process was already designed to run offline and independently of travis. Also, the GloBI server already keep an up-to-date cache of indexed datasets for the data indexing workflows. This cache can be re-used for data reviews. \r\n\r\nSuggest to create a workflows (e.g., bash script) to generate reviews for GloBI indexed datasets.
