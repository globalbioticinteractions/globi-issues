I'm only partly following you, but that doesn't sound good. I'm not sure what you mean is missing from tdwg, since http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/taxonRank exists.  Regardless, EOL should not treat taxa below species rank (supspecies, varieties, anything that's a child of a species level taxon) differently from other taxa in a systematic way. It's possible that somewhere in our background synonym providers someone has synonymized Enhydra lutris neiris with a parent or grandparent. That happens more often than I'd like.

This means that for an sub/infraspecies the taxon term http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/#scientificName is used along with http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/taxonRank . In our example, this means that _Enhydra lutris neiris_ is available in the http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/#scientificName and `Infraspecies` is populated in the http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/taxonRank . Even through all available fields are populated, for some reason, eol pages related to these infraspecies do not have the interaction data that is reported through GloBI. However, their genus page does. So, I am expecting that the eol data ingester doesn't like the infraspecies ranks. Note that the `Subspecies` do appear to be represented on the `Subspecies` level.\n\nI've poked around some more and found 1032 occurrences of taxa with rank `Infraspecies` that have EOL ids.

as neat as I was hoping for, but I think we should go ahead. The\nanimals and bacteria are indeed subspecies. Looks like the plants and fungi\nare mostly varieties, but since they lack the \"var.\" in the name, I doubt\nsorting them out and giving them their right rank would map them much\nbetter. I found at least one example on EOL where a \"var.\" and a\n\"var.\"-free interpretation of the same name did get mapped together, so we\ncan hope it won't make too much of a mess. Either way, it'll be a lot\nneater than mapping all their data up to genus...\n\n2015-02-09 21:35 GMT-05:00 Jorrit Poelen notifications@github.com:\n\n> Here's a few infraspecies.
