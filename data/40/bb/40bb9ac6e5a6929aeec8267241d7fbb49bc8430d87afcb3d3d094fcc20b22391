href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/blob/master/CHANGES\">jsoup's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>jsoup changelog</p>\n<p>Release 1.15.3 [2022-Aug-24]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Security: fixed an issue where the jsoup cleaner may incorrectly sanitize crafted XSS attempts if\nSafeList.preserveRelativeLinks is enabled.\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/security/advisories/GHSA-gp7f-rwcx-9369\">https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/security/advisories/GHSA-gp7f-rwcx-9369</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: the Cleaner will preserve the source position of cleaned elements, if source tracking is enabled in the\noriginal parse.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: the error messages output from Validate are more descriptive. Exceptions are now ValidationExceptions\n(extending IllegalArgumentException). Stack traces do not include the Validate class, to make it simpler to see\nwhere the exception originated. Common validation errors including malformed URLs and empty selector results have\nmore explicit error messages.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: the DataUtil would incorrectly read from InputStreams that emitted reads less than the requested size. This\nlead to incorrect results when parsing from chunked server responses, for e.g.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1807\">jhy/jsoup#1807</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Build Improvement: added implementation version and related fields to the jar manifest.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1809\">jhy/jsoup#1809</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>*** Release 1.15.2 [2022-Jul-04]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added the ability to track the position (line, column, index) in the original input source from where\na given node was parsed. Accessible via Node.sourceRange() and Element.endSourceRange().\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1790\">jhy/jsoup#1790</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Element.firstElementChild(), Element.lastElementChild(), Node.firstChild(), Node.lastChild(),\nas convenient accessors to those child nodes and elements.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Element.expectFirst(cssQuery), which is just like Element.selectFirst(), but instead of returning\na null if there is no match, will throw an IllegalArgumentException. This is useful if you want to simply abort\nprocessing if an expected match is not found.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when pretty-printing HTML, doctypes are emitted on a newline if there is a preceding comment.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1664\">jhy/jsoup#1664</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when pretty-printing, trim the leading and trailing spaces of textnodes in block tags when possible,\nso that they are indented correctly.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1798\">jhy/jsoup#1798</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in Element#selectXpath(), disable namespace awareness. This makes it possible to always select elements\nby their simple local name, regardless of whether an xmlns attribute was set.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1801\">jhy/jsoup#1801</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: when using the readToByteBuffer method, such as in Connection.Response.body(), if the document has not\nalready been parsed and must be read fully, and there is any maximum buffer size being applied, only the default\ninternal buffer size is read.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1774\">jhy/jsoup#1774</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...
