These include Darwin Core Archive, RSS, tables with custom schemas, iNaturalist, BatBase etc. \r\n\r\nSuggest to extend interaction type mapping support to all GloBI supported dataset types. \r\n\r\nPS Note that strategies similar to interaction type mapping can also be applied to other terms like taxonomic names (e.g., taxonomic name translations/resolution), life stages, localities, citations etc. This would allow for richer, modular data reviews with context-based perspectives (or mappings). E.g., use ITIS for taxon name mappings, or map all plant names to Plantae, 'because I don't need the specificity etc etc.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/573/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/573/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
