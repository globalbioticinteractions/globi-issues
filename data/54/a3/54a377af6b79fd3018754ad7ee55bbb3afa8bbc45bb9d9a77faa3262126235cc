Wow - you are fast! \n\nCouple of comments:\n1. to ensure inclusion in GloBI (and EOL), please fork a repository from http://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/template-dataset and update the globi.json, data files, repository name and README,md with appropriate info. \n2. In line 30 of interactions.tsv, you mentioned `Bald-sea-urchin disease` and `parasite of`. Assuming that this is a pathogen, I suggest using the scientific / latin name for the pathogen (perhaps _Listonella anguillarum_ or _Aeromonas salmonicida_?). Also suggest to use the interaction type `pathogen of` with id `RO:0002556`.\n3. rather than including a separate locality file, I'd recommend to expand these into the interactions.tsv file with a new line for each locality. Ideally, a centroid lat/lng pair would accompany the locality to make it easy to point to an (approximate) place on the map. Perhaps http://geonames.org can help you look up these coordinates.\n\nThanks for your contribution and for being patient with me!\n\nLet me know if you have any questions / comments.\n\n-jorrit\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/72907092/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/72907426","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/69#issuecomment-72907426","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/69","id":72907426,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyOTA3NDI2","user":{"login":"millerse","id":9950335,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5NTAzMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9950335?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/millerse","html_url":"https://github.com/millerse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/millerse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/millerse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/millerse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/millerse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/millerse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/millerse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/millerse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/millerse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/millerse/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-02-04T18:14:38Z","updated_at":"2015-02-04T18:14:38Z","body":"Will do!\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/72907426/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/72913435","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/69#issuecomment-72913435","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/69","id":72913435,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyOTEzNDM1","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-02-04T18:46:44Z","updated_at":"2015-02-04T18:46:44Z","body":"Great!

If so, I suggest to use the taxa instead with `pathogen of` interaction type. If not, I'd suggest to leave the name as is, and revisit as soon as we have a good way to encode this.\n\n@cmungall could you please provide an example is a separate archive on how to encode this situation.
