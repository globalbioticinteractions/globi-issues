I was hoping to implement this next to the existing export.  This way, you can have both aggregate as well as observation level data.  Please let me know if you have updates to the suggested EOL interaction darwin core structure / schema. . . if you share early and often, we'll be able to keep up with you guys ; )\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/21360311/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/21575373","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/6#issuecomment-21575373","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/6","id":21575373,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNTc1Mzcz","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-07-25T18:41:55Z","updated_at":"2013-07-25T18:41:55Z","body":"Hey Jen - if you download a new copy of the [darwin core archive](https://github.com/jhpoelen/eol-globi-data/wiki#access-via-data-file-downloads)  you'll find two additional files: associationAggregate.csv and observationAggregate.csv. This data should include only unique source-interactionType-target triples per study.  For instance, if a study reports four observations of Homo sapiens eating Haddock, only a single association and observation is reported for that study.  \n\nCurious to hear your feedback!\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/21575373/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
