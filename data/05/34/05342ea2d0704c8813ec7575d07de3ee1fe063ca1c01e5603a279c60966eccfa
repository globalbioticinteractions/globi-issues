Two questions:\n1. You mention that the links are  \"[...] based on 6712 feeding observations collected from 745 sources [...]\". Do you have the reference available so that the foodweb links can be traced to their original source?\n2. In the paper, you mention various locations on and around Sanak Island. Would you happen to have a shape file or similar available so that the foodwebs can expressed in a spatially explicit way? I really liked how Szoboszlai et al. 2015 (https://github.com/jhpoelen/eol-globi-data/issues/158) published their shapefiles along with the links.\n\nCurious to hear your response.\n\n-jorrit \n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/136527877/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/140239507","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/159#issuecomment-140239507","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/159","id":140239507,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MDIzOTUwNw==","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-15T00:18:11Z","updated_at":"2015-09-15T00:18:11Z","body":"Wood et al. 2015 is now available through GloBI.
