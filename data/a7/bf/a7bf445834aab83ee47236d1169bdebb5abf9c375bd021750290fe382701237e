The root cause was that the taxon associated with Zika virus EOL:541190 was not resolved fully, meaning that the taxonomic path (e.g. `\"Viruses | Ssrna viruses | Ssrna positive-strand viruses, no DNA stage | Flaviviridae | Flavivirus | Spondweni virus group | Zika virus\"`) was not populated. After fixing the taxon cache, the Zika virus taxon has now been resolved and can now be searched.\n\n![screen shot 2016-04-08 at 9 33 53 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1084872/14390719/5f653c0c-fd6d-11e5-8947-d258e10de960.png)\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/207506305/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
