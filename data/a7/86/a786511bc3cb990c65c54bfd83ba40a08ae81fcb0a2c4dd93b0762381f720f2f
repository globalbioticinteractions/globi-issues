The reason the database is not archived is as follows _\"Site access is free, however exact location of crayfish species is restricted to prevent commercial exploitation of sensitive species.\"_ This is under the Usage Notes section in the paper if you would like to check yourself. The usage is limited to a simple format for non-registered member of the IAA (see below), which is frustrating but I believe was implemented to prevent either vulnerable native species being exploited, or malicious spread of invasives.\r\n\r\n\"The platform is open for anyone but there are two layers of users. Non-registered users can view our maps in a simplified format, with a hexagonal overlay covering the exact locations. While this provides a general overview of crayfish distributions, _registered members of the [International Association of Astacology](https://www.astacology.org/) can access more advanced features.
