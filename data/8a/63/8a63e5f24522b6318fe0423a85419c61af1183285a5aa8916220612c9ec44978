Pelagic fish foodweb linkages.\r\n\r\nOne way to deal with missing predator information is the pick a higher order taxon (e.g., Actinopterygii or perhaps even Chordata/Animalia). Another way is to contact the author and ask where they keep the data. Perhaps you can do both in parallel? \r\n\r\nFrom experience, I know that the Australian CSIRO are well organized and well funded, so they might have alternate ways to get to the data (see e.g., https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/398). \r\n\r\nCurious to hear what you come up with.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/818008976/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
