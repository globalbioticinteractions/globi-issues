Continuing on #1031 I also started working on the fourth characteristic - biologoical sex names and ids for source and target organisms. \r\n\r\nSo, this is more complicated than the other 3 characteristics. Here https://tinyurl.com/BioSNames , I have a list of values for the name and id for a set of interaction records (record as in one row in interactions.tsv describing one interaction). Now, I understand that the organism(s) in question for a record could occur in clusters or groups and that is why I see values in column ```source/target-SexName``` like \"11 males, 4 females, 2 juveniles\" or \"1 male, 1 female, 5 juveniles\" or \"1 male 4 female\". But, I was wondering if this was the original purpose for this column. If I understand correctly, these values are describing both names and quantities ascribing to each sex. Then maybe there should be another column describing the quantity for the number of organisms in  each record, and then such collective values might make sense, only if the column ```source/target-SexId``` also contains appropriate delimited ids. This may also call for further annotation of these columns automatically by GloBI pipeline.\r\n\r\nLet me know your views.\r\n\r\nUnrelated : While going through the list in the, it is funny how 'female' has been mis-spelled the most out of all the terms :-) . And a  lot of spanish terms! \r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/1032/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/1032/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
