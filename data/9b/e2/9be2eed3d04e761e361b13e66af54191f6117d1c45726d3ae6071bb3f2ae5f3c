If the taxa are found with a same name, higher order ranks are extracted and compared to the originally matched taxon. If either kingdom, phylum or class are different, the match is considered a homonym and is excluded from the results. For a test case, see https://github.com/jhpoelen/eol-globi-data/blob/9e2a76bc2775323445f6b3a03c6daee285a2c78b/eol-globi-data-tool/src/test/java/org/eol/globi/service/TaxonUtilTest.java .\n\nFeatures will be available within days, on the next deploy of GloBI.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/93002685/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
