I can only replicate this on this taxon concept; other pages that I've tried don't have similar behavior. It is behaving as though the only English common name for this taxon is \"Brown\". What it returns between the <content> tags, as I understand it, is all values present in the section where the string match was made- scientific names or any one language in the common names. The french name for this taxon concept also works, but neither of the English common names displaying in the common names subtab (Brown Wood Owl, Brown Wood-owl) are recognized. I tried re-indexing the page. I'm not sure if that reaches into the database; if it does, this may take a few hours to have any effect...\n","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/140521899/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/146400320","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/175#issuecomment-146400320","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/175","id":146400320,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NjQwMDMyMA==","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-08T02:39:51Z","updated_at":"2015-10-08T02:39:51Z","body":"@jhammock just repeated http://eol.org:80/api/search/1.0.xml?q=Brown&exact=true and same (unexpected) result is present: Brown Wood Owl (Strix leptogrammica). \n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/146400320/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/146402688","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/175#issuecomment-146402688","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/175","id":146402688,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NjQwMjY4OA==","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-08T02:46:42Z","updated_at":"2015-10-08T02:46:42Z","body":"Also, found that \"blue\" resolves to \"Blue Wildebeest (_Connochaetes taurinus_).
