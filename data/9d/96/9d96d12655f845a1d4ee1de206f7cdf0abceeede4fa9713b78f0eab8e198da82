This looks fantastic and I can see how it would be highly useful for our purposes of gathering host-virus interaction data — its true that much of that information will be in biomedical literature.\r\n\r\nA downside of biomedical literature is that they often don’t fully identify the host animals (i.e., “bat” or “civet” rather than the full scientific name with species ID) — its possible that we can salvage many of these classifications by means of *geocoordinates* for the observations and comparing with host geographic range maps.  “Bat” may be too vague, but \"Rhinolophus sp.” is likely salvage-able given a geocoordinate.  Anyway, I mention that because we will ultimately need species-specific data on both viruses and hosts in order to do our targeted analyses.  Is there a way to add additional taxonomic fields to the great Google sheet you sent?\r\n\r\nIn general, I’m glad to bring SIB into this collaboration and have them interface directly with the postdoc based at Arizona State.
