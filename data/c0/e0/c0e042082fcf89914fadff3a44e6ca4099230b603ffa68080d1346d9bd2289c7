The changes to the forked maven-s3-plugin include a simplification of the code, added testcases and dependency removal of unmaintained kuali libraries. Also, a more recent version of the aws s3 api is used. \r\n \r\n2. for automated reviews, command-line tool ```s3cmd```is now used instead of ```awscli```. The former was easier to configure with non-aws endpoints.\r\n\r\nWith the migration complete, increased usage/storage of GloBI data products can be managed without having to pay storage rent by the hour and per-per-byte download bandwidth charges. Also, this continuous backup schemes can be implemented without having to rake up even more charges. \r\n\r\nSo in short, migrating away from aws s3 has freed the project from significant use changes and will hopefully make it easier to sustain. \r\n\r\n  ","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/741127842/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
