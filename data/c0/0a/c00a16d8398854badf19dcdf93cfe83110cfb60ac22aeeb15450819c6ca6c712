I would guess from this that our search taxon is likely a herbivore. \n\nOr  following your example  we could ask: Do all \"fruit bats\" (Megachiroptera) eat fruit only?  The interesting and important result that some are reported to eat insects is visible here by chance. But this easiely could get lost below the \"more\" button as many fruits eating interactions are reported. \nIf the result highlights Viridplantae and Insecta this becomes obvious. \n\nAs we can expect some level of evolutionary conservation in species interactions it would in my eyes be obviously interesting to get an overview for this when higher level taxa are searched\n\nAnd also for the general usfulness  of the output (this might be a seperate issue/feature request):\nIf we search for a higher taxonomic level (e.g. the phylum Apicomplexa) we get so many results (in this case for just one search species Plasmodium) but no idea what is found in total.
