Here are some items that I think would make this easier for researchers. \r\n\r\n- Clear definitions of reference, data source, network. Through the API this is also mentioned as study_citation and study_source_citation. Metadata and uniformity on all these terms would enhance clarity. \r\n- A section on the About page describing best practice for citing data extracted from GloBI: \"How to cite GloBI data?\"\r\n- A web-hosted bibliography. This is currently only available for download. Ideally this could also provide links to the original document. \r\n- provide a downloadable list or bibtex of all the references from the \"Supported by\" page (example [here](https://www.globalbioticinteractions.org/references.html?accordingTo=globi%3Ahurlbertlab%2Fdietdatabase&interactionType=interactsWith)); Make sure supported by provides full source reference information instead of short names (e.g. see short versions provided for the interactions extracted from GMPD) \r\n- Anywhere are the number of references per interaction given? This could be integrated as a weight in the visualized network. Similar, could you attach specific dates to references, perhaps by publication date, in order to filter to only the oldest interaction or the newest interaction. This would also open the door for interaction density timelines. Currently there is a strong spatial component to the interaction browsing, but the temporal aspect is untapped. \r\n- Another identifier would be to classify how data was extracted - from primary literature, aggregator, citizen science platform, etc and let users filter based on their needs. \r\n-  GBIF has made strides in updating their practice. And could be a model for how to do this. That platform has 1) a popup before data download discussing \"Free of cost – not free of responsibilities\", 2) a doi for each download (this may also handle the issue of different versions of GLoBI), and 3) [citation guidelines](https://www.gbif.org/citation-guidelines) 4) their [data user agreement](https://www.gbif.org/terms/data-user). \r\n\r\nVery interested in the opinions of data managers and globi users if this is overkill, scoping of how much work this is to integrate, and how to prioritize this topic.
