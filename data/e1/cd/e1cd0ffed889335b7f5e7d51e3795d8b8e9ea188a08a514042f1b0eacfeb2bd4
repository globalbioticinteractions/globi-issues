I'm not familiar with this area. Naively, I can conceive of different schemes. Where only a small number of interactors are studied, one can imagine a single character \"interaction\" with the state being the set of interactors. But I think this may probably be a bad scheme. Instead I imagine the preferred scheme would be to have a character \"interacts with T\" for every taxon studied, and the states being 1/0 depending on whether an interaction is observed, or possibly different values for different interaction types (parasitism, commensalism).\n\nAs an aside, are there any plans to support use of controlled vocabularies or ontologies in charJSON (analogous ot recent extensions to nexml)? I think this could be done in a rather neat seamless way using JSON-LD. For an example of a tool that supports ontologized characters see https://github.com/phenoscape/Phenex by @balhoff \n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/56194621/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/comments/56207300","html_url":"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/93#issuecomment-56207300","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/93","id":56207300,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MjA3MzAw","user":{"login":"proopnarine","id":6475565,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NzU1NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6475565?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/proopnarine","html_url":"https://github.com/proopnarine","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/proopnarine/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/proopnarine/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/proopnarine/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/proopnarine/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/proopnarine/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/proopnarine/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/proopnarine/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/proopnarine/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/proopnarine/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-09-19T17:21:31Z","updated_at":"2014-10-30T17:07:24Z","body":"The binary scheme is interesting; it would be more or less the adjacency or connectance matrix of the group? I worry that many of those characters, however, would be highly correlated if many of your species belonged to nested sets of interactions. Maybe the binary matrix could be condensed into a distance matrix using something like a Hamming distance? Just a thought.\n\nPeter\n\nDr. Peter D.
